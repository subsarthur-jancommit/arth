/**
 * The palette itself — everything Base UI, loaded on first open.
 *
 * Nothing here is on any route's initial graph. `./index.tsx` explains the
 * split and why `e2e/route-budget.e2e.ts` is the gate that proves it.
 *
 * ## Why the rows are anchors, and why not the site's own `Link`
 *
 * They are anchors because a palette whose rows are buttons quietly takes
 * away middle-click, copy-link, and the announcement "link" — and because an
 * `href` is what makes a result a place rather than an action.
 *
 * They are **not** `components/ui/link`, and that is a measurement rather
 * than a preference. `components/ui/link` also lives in the header's eager
 * chunk, so importing it here put a module in both an eager chunk and this
 * async one; webpack resolved that by duplicating the whole header group,
 * and `/en/work` went from 871 KB to 914 KB — over its ceiling — for code
 * that had already been downloaded. Measured both ways:
 *
 * | palette imports        | `/en/work` | eager copies of the header chunk |
 * | ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
 * | `components/ui/link`   | 914 KB     | 2                                |
 * | a plain anchor         | 880 KB     | 1                                |
 *
 * What is lost by not using it — locale prefixing — this index does not need:
 * every href it builds already carries its locale. What would have been lost
 * by using a bare anchor, a client-side navigation, is put back by the click
 * handler below, which is Next's own router and is already on every page.
 *
 * ## The row choreography, and why it is not GSAP
 *
 * The rows rise and fade in on open, staggered. That is written with the Web
 * Animations API rather than the site's usual GSAP, and the reason is the
 * measurement Tahap 28 ended on: a module shared between an eager chunk and
 * this async one makes webpack duplicate the whole chunk group. GSAP is in
 * the eager graph of most routes here, so importing it into the palette risks
 * paying for it twice on every page — for an animation nobody has opened.
 *
 * `element.animate()` costs nothing to import, runs on the compositor rather
 * than on a timer, and therefore does **not** add the second `requestAnimation
 * Frame` loop `CLAUDE.md` #6 forbids. It moves `transform` and `opacity` only
 * (#4), reads its numbers from `vault/motion/tokens.ts` — which is types and
 * constants, so it carries no runtime weight — and is skipped entirely under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, leaving every row at its final, fully visible
 * state (#5).
 *
 * ## Why the filtering and the ordering are ours
 *
 * Base UI filters on the item's string value, which here is the title. That
 * would make this a second navigation menu: typing a client's name would find
 * nothing, because the client is not in the title.
 *
 * So matching happens against everything the row *shows*, and the ordering
 * comes with it — `matchScore` in `lib/content/search-index.ts` carries the
 * measurement that forced this. In short: matching on the whole row is what
 * makes a client findable, and it is also what let a passing mention in a
 * page description outrank an entry's own title. Ranking is what keeps both
 * true, and it applies to the groups as well as the rows inside them: the
 * group holding the best answer is the one shown first, so the highlight —
 * and therefore Enter — lands on it.
