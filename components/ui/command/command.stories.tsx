/**
 * The search palette, over a fixed index.
 *
 * ## Why this story exists, having been declined twice
 *
 * Tahap 28 and 29 both recorded "no Storybook story" with the same reason:
 * the palette fetches its index from a route and reads next-intl's locale, so
 * a story would have to stub both and would then be showing a mock.
 *
 * Half of that was true and half was laziness.
 * `components/ui/language-switcher` has had a story with
 * `NextIntlClientProvider` since it shipped, so the locale half was already
 * solved here. The index half was fixed by changing the component rather than
 * by faking the network: `entries` is a prop, and when it is given the
 * component renders it instead of fetching. Nothing here is a mock of the
 * palette — it is the palette, over entries that hold still.
 *
 * ## What it is worth beyond a catalogue
 *
 * `e2e/storybook-a11y.e2e.ts` audits every story, so these add an axe pass on
 * an open palette in isolation from any page — including its two states that
 * a page-level gate can only reach by breaking the network.
 */

/*
 * The `search` namespace, written out rather than imported from
 * `messages/en.json`, for the reason `language-switcher.stories.tsx` records:
 * the JSON is typed through `messages/en.d.json.ts`, which needs
 * `allowArbitraryExtensions`, and turning that on for one story would loosen
 * module resolution repo-wide.
