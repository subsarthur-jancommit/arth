/**
 * Site header.
 *
 * Replaces the Satūs starter header, which showed a "Satūs" wordmark, the raw
 * pathname as a debug readout, and links to darkroom's own repository. Useful
 * while forking; not something to ship on a studio's site.
 *
 * ## The in-page anchors belonged to the page, and now nothing links them
 *
 * The home page is one long page (`docs/ROADMAP.md` §1.2), and until Tahap 54
 * this header rendered its four section anchors alongside the three routes —
 * seven links, two of them duplicating a route's own name. `ROUTE_LINKS`
 * below carries the argument and the count.
 *
 * The sections did not disappear; the *shortcut* to them did. They are
 * reached by reading the page, which is what a page that long is for, and the
 * header now answers only "what pages does this site have".
 *
 * ## Locale
 *
 * Every internal link goes through `components/ui/link`, which routes through
 * next-intl so the reader's language survives the navigation. `usePathname`
 * here is next-intl's too — it returns the path with the prefix stripped, so
 * active-state comparison is template-against-template. Using the bare
 * `next/navigation` version compares `/id` against `/`, which is never equal,
 * and every item renders inactive. See `components/ui/link/link.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## One navigation, which on a phone is a popover — the fork
 *
 * MENU was a React state toggle over a dropdown of three 11px mono links.
 * With scripting off the button did nothing and the nav stayed
 * `display: none`, so a phone had no route links in its header at all; only
 * the footer led anywhere (the design-critique workflow, deferred item 9).
 *
 * Now the nav **is** a `popover="auto"`, and MENU its `popovertarget`: the
 * browser opens it, closes it on Escape or a tap outside, returns focus to
 * the button — none of it needs a script. On a phone it is a sheet under the
 * bar with the three routes at display size; on desktop the same element is
 * the header's row, as it always was.
 *
 * One element, not two. The first version of this rendered a second nav for
 * the sheet, and that put a hidden copy of every route link — and a second
 * `aria-current` — into the desktop page. Five gates walked into it, each
 * reasonably: a "first link to /en/practice/…" or "every `[data-press]`" that
 * landed on a link nobody could see. The sheet also carried the practices;
 * they are gone from it for the reason `ROUTE_LINKS` gives — this nav answers
 * "what pages does this site have", and the footer's index lists the
 * practices on every page.
 *
 * What the script adds (each from review): the button reads "Close" while
 * the sheet is open, read from the element so a tap before hydration counts;
 * focus landing anywhere outside the sheet closes it, and what it covers is
 * `inert` while it covers it, so neither Tab nor a screen reader ends up on
 * content hidden under an opaque sheet; a link that navigates closes it,
 * because each page renders its own header and Next keeps the previous page
 * in a hidden `<Activity>` — without this, Back reveals that page with its
 * sheet still open; MENU targets its own nav by reference, because that
 * `<Activity>` also means two `#header-nav` in one document; crossing into
 * desktop closes it; and a browser without `popover` gets a plain toggle with
 * `aria-expanded`, Escape, a tap outside, and focus handed back.

/**
 * The whole of the primary navigation: the site's routes, and nothing else.
 *
 * Locale-free templates: `components/ui/link` adds the prefix itself, and
 * handing it `/en/work` would produce `/en/en/work`.
 *
 * ## Why the home page's section anchors are no longer here
 *
 * Until Tahap 54 this nav rendered the home page's four in-page anchors
 * (`#work`, `#practice`, `#studio`, `#contact`) *and* these three routes. On
 * `/en` that shipped **seven** links inside one `<nav aria-label="Primary">`,
 * of which two pairs carried the same accessible name and different
 * destinations — `Work` → `#work` beside `Work` → `/en/work`, and the same
 * for `Studio`. A reader cannot tell those apart, and a screen-reader user
 * walking the link list gets the ambiguity twice.
 *
 * It also broke this file's own rule three lines further down: the row is
 * capped at one line, and seven is not one line.
 *
 * So the nav answers one question — *what pages does this site have* — and
 * the home page's sections answer a different one, by being scrolled to. The
 * wordmark to the left is the home link and carries `aria-label="<brand> —
 * home"`; a fourth item spelling "Home" beside it would be the same duplicate
 * this change removes.
 *
 * Three and not more. `taste-skill` SKILL.md §4.7 caps the navigation at one
 * line and 80px; since the fork that is advice, not a gate. These three
 * are the site's top-level shapes: the work, the practice behind it, and the
 * writing about it — `/practice/<value>` has no index route of its own, and
 * is reached from the home page's practice list and the catalogue's chips.
