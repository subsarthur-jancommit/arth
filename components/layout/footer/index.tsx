/**
 * Site footer.
 *
 * Replaces the Satūs starter footer, which carried darkroom's logo and a "use
 * this template" link — correct for a starter, wrong for a studio's own site.
 *
 * ## The attribution stays
 *
 * What was removed is the *template* link, not the credit. Satūs is MIT
 * licensed and `docs/PROVENANCE.md` requires the attribution, so
 * darkroom.engineering is still named, as a sentence in the colophon rather
 * than as a logo lockup. The typefaces are named there too: a colophon that
 * lists its type is a convention of the field this site is trying to belong
 * to, and it costs one line.
 *
 * ## Where this runs
 *
 * The file declares no `'use client'` and holds no state, but it is imported
 * by `components/layout/wrapper`, which does — so in practice it renders as a
 * client component. `useTranslations` works either way: the layout wraps the
 * tree in `NextIntlClientProvider`. Written without state so it can move back
 * to the server the moment Wrapper stops needing to be a client component.
 */

/*
 * Read once at module scope, never during render.
 *
 * `new Date()` inside the component body is a clock read, and under Cache
 * Components that makes the enclosing boundary dynamic. Because this footer
 * renders inside `Wrapper` (a Client Component), the effect is not a slower
 * render — React bails the whole boundary to client-side rendering, and the
 * prerendered HTML for `/en` and `/id` ships with no header, no footer and no
 * page content at all. Nothing warns: the build succeeds, dev looks correct,
 * and only the served HTML shows it. Measured before and after.
 *
 * At module scope the read happens once when the bundle loads, outside any
 * render, so the prerender stays static. The value ages with the deploy
 * rather than with the calendar.

 * the same fields against the CMS; this footer cannot, because it renders
 * inside the client `Wrapper` and has no server data of its own. Sharing the
 * constant is what makes that a *fallback* rather than a second opinion, and
 * what makes wiring the CMS through later one edit instead of three.

        The wordmark, moving with the reader — Tahap 42.

        `components/ui/marquee` shipped with the fork and had **zero**
        consumers for forty-one stages while occupying Tempus order 6 in the
        loop table. This is its first home, and the first visible spend of
        `--scroll-velocity`: the strip carries a base speed and the reader's
        own scrolling adds to it, so the footer answers movement instead of
        sitting still under it.

        `MOTION-SPEC.md` §0's third category, and the purest case of it — no
        beginning, no end, `transform` only, and switched off entirely under
        `prefers-reduced-motion` (§0.2 rule 4), which the component did not do
        until this stage.

        **One per page, never two.** `taste-skill` §4 is explicit that two
        scrolling strips read as lazy filler, and this one is in the footer,
        which every route renders — so this is the site's only slot and it is
        now spent.

        `aria-hidden` on the whole strip: it is the studio's name, which the
        page already carries in its `<title>`, its JSON-LD and the header
        wordmark. Repeating it to a screen reader three times is noise, and
        `Marquee` duplicates its children to fill the width, so the repeats
        would be announced too.

          Site navigation, and it lives here rather than in the header for a
          measured reason.

          Tahap 20 counted the onward links on every route: `/en/work` has
          eleven, a practice page three, and **a project page one** — the next
          project. The footer carried no navigation at all, on every route,
          while a project page is the one most likely to be a landing page
          from a search result or a shared link.

          `components/layout/header` already decided, with a sound argument,
          not to carry the home page's section anchors on inner routes: they
          would be links that silently do nothing. That argument is about
          anchors. Every link below is a **real route**, so it cannot die —
          which is why this belongs here and the header stays untouched.

          `Portfolio Grid`, the pattern this site follows, puts its primary
          call to action at "Project Card Hover + Footer Contact". The footer
          was already the site's second entry point; it simply had nothing to
          enter.
