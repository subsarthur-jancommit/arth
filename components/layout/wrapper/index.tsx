 * canvas here per page instead of using the shared canvas in the layout — pick
 * one of the two strategies, not both.
 *
 * @param props - Component props
 * @param props.theme - Color theme to apply to the page
 * @param props.lenis - Whether to enable smooth scrolling with Lenis
 * @param props.webgl - Whether to mount the WebGL canvas for this page
 * @param props.children - Page content
 * @param props.className - Additional CSS classes
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Basic usage with theme
 * export default function Page() {
 *   return (
 *     <Wrapper theme="dark">
 *       <section>My page content</section>
 *     </Wrapper>
 *   )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Page-scoped WebGL canvas
 * export default function WebGLPage() {
 *   return (
 *     <Wrapper theme="light" webgl>
 *       <WebGLTunnel>
 *         <My3DScene />
 *       </WebGLTunnel>
 *       <section>Content overlaying 3D</section>
 *     </Wrapper>
 *   )

 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Disable smooth scrolling
 * export default function StaticPage() {

           * state from Tahap 40 until Tahap 54 — the example this comment
           * used to cite as the route that needed nothing.
