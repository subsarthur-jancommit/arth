# Pull, never push.
#
# Runs every five minutes via `arth-deploy.timer`. Fetches the branch, and when
# there is something new: builds, then restarts the server.
#
# ## Why this exists instead of a GitHub Actions runner
#
# `subsarthur-jancommit/arth` (until 2026-10-04 `ashaamoon-lang/-1`, also
# public) is a **public** repository. A self-hosted runner on a
# public repo is a path for a pull request from a fork to execute code on this
# machine — GitHub says not to do it, and the earlier draft of this
# infrastructure recommended it anyway because nobody had checked the repo's
# visibility. This design has no inbound path at all: no port, no webhook, no
# registration token, no GitHub credential on the box.
#
# The cost is stated plainly: a deploy lands within five minutes rather than
# instantly. That is the price of the attack surface being zero.
#
# Triggering a deploy means pushing a commit. Nothing else can start one.

# ## Why the whole script is one function
#
# This file lives in the repository it deploys, and step one is
# `git reset --hard`. Bash reads a script incrementally as it runs, so a script
# that rewrites itself mid-execution can jump into the middle of the *new*
# bytes — a failure that looks like nonsense and only happens on the runs where
# the file actually changed.
#
# Wrapping everything in a function and invoking it on the last line forces
# bash to parse the entire body before any of it executes. After that the file
# on disk can change freely.
#
# This is also why `ExecStart` points straight at this file in the checkout
# rather than a copy under /usr/local/bin: the copy would go stale the moment
# this script was edited, and nobody would notice until they read a deploy log
# that did not match the code.
