# It replaces the twenty-three `gcloud` commands the runbook used to ask you to
# type by hand. That count was the problem: a setup that needs twenty-three
# commands right in a row is not testing your care, it is blaming you for its
# own shape.
#
# ## What it will not do
#
# It never deletes anything. A previous half-finished attempt leaves real
# resources behind, and the safe move is to reuse what is already correct and
# *report* what is not — deleting on your behalf is how someone loses a machine
# they were still using.
#
# It also refuses to print the bootstrap command until DNS actually resolves to
# this machine. Caddy asks Let's Encrypt for a certificate the moment it
# starts, Let's Encrypt rate-limits failures, and a domain locked out for hours
# is a failure that heals by waiting rather than by fixing — the most
# confusing kind there is.

  DNS is correct, so bootstrap is safe to run. Connect:

      gcloud compute ssh ${VM} --zone=${ZONE} --tunnel-through-iap

  then, inside the VM:

      sudo rm -rf /tmp/arth-infra
      sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -y -qq git
      git clone --branch main \\
        https://github.com/subsarthur-jancommit/arth.git /tmp/arth-infra
      sudo bash /tmp/arth-infra/infra/bootstrap-lab.sh ${DOMAIN}

  That takes 12–18 minutes. When it finishes:

      bash /tmp/arth-infra/infra/doctor.sh
