# Run ONCE on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instance, as a sudo-capable user:
#
#   sudo bash infra/bootstrap-lab.sh lab.example.com
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run. Every step checks before it acts, because the
# most likely reason to run this a second time is that the first run failed
# halfway and re-running must not double a swapfile or a repo entry.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do:
#   - install `ufw`. The GCP VPC firewall already governs ingress, and two
#     places to get a firewall wrong is one too many.
#   - hold any secret. Sanity's write token never reaches this machine.
#   - register the GitHub Actions runner. That needs a short-lived token only
#     you can mint — see infra/README.md step 6.

The machine is provisioned and serving. One thing remains, and it needs you:

  Install Claude Code and log in:
      sudo -u ${APP_USER} -H bash -lc 'curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash'
      sudo -iu ${APP_USER}
      claude

Deploys are already running on a timer — nothing to register, no token, no
inbound port. Check it with:

    systemctl list-timers arth-deploy
    journalctl -u arth-deploy -n 40

Caddy will not obtain a certificate until ${DOMAIN} resolves to this machine's
external IP. Check first:

    dig +short ${DOMAIN}
