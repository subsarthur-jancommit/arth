# PROVENANCE

Origin and licence of every piece of third-party material in this repository.

**The rule that governs this file:** if a licence could not be verified by
reading the source's own `LICENSE` file (or an explicit published licensing
policy), **its code does not enter this repository.** Studying it is fine.
Copying it is not.

All licences below were verified on **2026-08-29** by fetching the raw file
from the source repository, not by trusting a summary, a README badge, or a
search result.

## 1. The foundation

### Satūs — vendored as the base of this repository

|           |                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source    | https://github.com/darkroomengineering/satus                        |
| Version   | `3.0.0`, commit `8cdce31`                                           |
| Licence   | **MIT** — verified from `LICENSE`                                   |
| Copyright | Copyright (c) 2024 darkroom.engineering                             |
| Status    | **Vendored.** Whole repository copied without upstream git history. |

The MIT licence requires the copyright notice and permission text to be
retained in all copies or substantial portions. **darkroom.engineering's notice
is kept in full in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (§ Satūs), unmodified, and must
stay there.** Until 2026-10-04 it was the repository's root `LICENSE`, and this
section required the root file to stay darkroom's. On that date the owner gave
the project its own licence — the root `LICENSE` is now MIT, Copyright (c)
2026 PEEKABOO — and the upstream notice moved, whole, into the notices file
(`docs/HANDOFF.md` §4.7). Moving the notice keeps the licence's condition;
deleting it would break it.

`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (also from upstream) is retained for the same reason.

Modifications made after vendoring are in git history, starting from the
pristine vendor commit, so the diff against upstream is auditable at any time.

## 2. Dependencies that arrived with Satūs

All are ordinary npm dependencies, used unmodified via `package.json` — no
source copied into this repository. Licences verified from each project's
own `LICENSE`:

| Package                            | Licence                    | Notes                                         |

| `tempus`                           | MIT — darkroom.engineering | shared RAF loop                               |
| `hamo`                             | MIT — darkroom.engineering | React utility hooks                           |
| `@react-three/fiber`               | MIT — pmndrs               | React renderer for three.js                   |
| `@react-three/drei`                | MIT — pmndrs               | R3F helpers                                   |
| `three`                            | MIT                        |                                               |
| `postprocessing`                   | MIT                        |                                               |
| `@theatre/core`, `@theatre/studio` | **Apache-2.0**             | animation sequencer — see note below          |
| `gsap`, `@gsap/react`              | _see note_                 |                                               |
| `next`, `react`, `react-dom`       | MIT                        |                                               |
| `tailwindcss`                      | MIT                        |                                               |
| `zustand`, `zod`, `clsx`           | MIT                        |                                               |

**Theatre.js is Apache-2.0, not MIT.** For use as an unmodified dependency
this makes no practical difference. It matters if Theatre source is ever
copied or modified: Apache-2.0 requires stating changes and preserving
`NOTICE`. Do not copy Theatre source into `vault/`.

**GSAP licensing — checked 2026-09-18, and the open question is closed.**

This entry stood open from 2026-08-29 as _"before production launch, confirm
the current terms for the specific plugins used (`ScrollTrigger`, `SplitText`,
`Draggable`)."_ Two things were wrong with it, and both are corrected here
rather than quietly rewritten.

**The plugin list was wrong.** `Draggable` is not used — it has never been
imported. What the source actually imports:

```
11 ×  from 'gsap'
 9 ×  from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger'
 2 ×  from 'gsap/SplitText'
```

And the list omitted the one plugin the project made a decision about:
**`Flip`**, which `vault/motion/flip/index.ts` deliberately does _not_ use —
it hand-rolls FLIP on the Web Animations API instead. A provenance list that
names an unused plugin while missing a refused one describes a project nobody
is working on.

**The terms are settled, and they were verifiable on disk.** From the installed
package rather than a blog post or a badge:

```
node_modules/gsap  v3.15.0
  package.json  "license": "Standard 'no charge' license: https://gsap.com/standard-license"
  README.md:62  "Thanks to Webflow, GSAP is now 100% FREE including ALL of the
                 bonus plugins like SplitText, MorphSVG, and all the others
                 that were exclusively available to Club GSAP members ...
                 even for commercial use"
```

And from https://gsap.com/standard-license itself: use on any website or web
application is granted at no charge, commercial projects included, with the
former Club plugins — `SplitText` among them — covered. The one restriction
that bites is using GSAP to build a no-code visual animation builder competing
with Webflow's, which is not what this project is.

**So: no licensing obstacle to the animation work, including `SplitText`.**

Stated precisely, per §7: what is closed is _"this was never checked"_. The
evidence above is dated, and a licence can change — so the pre-launch checklist
keeps a line for re-reading it, not for discovering it.

## 3. Skills vendored into `.claude/skills/`

### `ui-ux-pro-max`

|              |                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Source       | https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill                  |
| Version      | `2.13.0`, commit `8bd29e7`                                               |
| Licence      | **MIT** — Copyright (c) 2024 Next Level Builder, verified from `LICENSE` |
| Installed at | `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/`                                          |
| Licence copy | `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/LICENSE` — retained as MIT requires        |

Vendored as files (not installed as a plugin) so it is committed with the
repository: any agent that opens this repo inherits it with no setup step.

Contents per its own `SKILL.md`: 79 searchable styles (50 active), 192 product
palettes with reasoning profiles, 74 font pairings, 119 UX guidelines, 105
icons, 17 GSAP presets, 25 chart types, 22 technology stacks — including
`data/stacks/threejs.csv`, which is directly relevant here.

> Note on a discrepancy, for accuracy: the repository's `skill.json` advertises
> "84 UI styles … 98 UX guidelines" while `SKILL.md` in the same commit says
> "79 searchable styles … 119 UX guidelines". The `SKILL.md` figures are the
> ones the search data actually exposes and are what is quoted above.

Only `ui-ux-pro-max` was taken from that repo. It also ships
`design`, `design-system`, `ui-styling`, `brand`, `banner-design` and
`slides` (≈11 MB total); they were left out to keep repository weight and
agent context focused. They are available at the same MIT terms if wanted.

### `taste-skill`

|              |                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source       | https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill                         |
| Version      | v2 (experimental), commit `ccbc156`, 2026-08-24                 |
| Licence      | **MIT** — Copyright (c) 2026 Leonxlnx, verified from `LICENSE`  |
| Installed at | `.claude/skills/taste-skill/`                                   |
| Licence copy | `.claude/skills/taste-skill/LICENSE` — retained as MIT requires |

Vendored as files rather than installed with `npx skills add`, for the same
reason `ui-ux-pro-max` was: it is committed with the repository, so any agent
that opens this repo inherits it with no setup step.

**The licence was verified by fetching and reading the repository's own
`LICENSE` file**, not a README badge and not a search result — `CLAUDE.md` #18,
and the reason for that rule is §5 below.

What was taken:

| Path          | From upstream                 | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SKILL.md`    | `skills/taste-skill/SKILL.md` | The v2 skill itself — the three dials, the layout hard rules, the AI-tell list, and the 60-box pre-flight check                                                                                     |
| `references/` | `research/`                   | Background research on why models produce incomplete output and the documented techniques against it. Directly relevant to a repo whose recurring lesson is that a green gate is not a correct site |
| `LICENSE`     | `LICENSE`                     | Required by MIT                                                                                                                                                                                     |

What was left behind: eleven sibling skills (`gpt-tasteskill`, `brutalist-`,
`soft-`, `minimalist-`, `redesign-`, `output-`, `stitch-`, `image-to-code-`,
two `imagegen-` skills, `brandkit`) plus `assets/` and `examples/` (≈1.4 MB),
to keep repository weight and agent context focused. All are available at the
same MIT terms if wanted.

> Note on a discrepancy, for accuracy: the vendored file's own frontmatter
> declares `name: design-taste-frontend`, which is the upstream install name,
> while the directory here is `taste-skill` (its path in the source repo and
> the name used throughout `docs/stages/TAHAP-34.md`). The file was **not**
> edited — a vendored file that has been quietly rewritten is a provenance
> record you cannot trust — so the two names differ on purpose.

**How it is used here is a decision, not an adoption.**
`docs/stages/TAHAP-34.md` §5 lists the rules this project adopts and the
defect each one closes; §6 lists the five it rejects and why — among them the
skill's `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` example, which
violates three separate hard rules in `CLAUDE.md`. Where the two disagree,
`CLAUDE.md` wins.

Nothing was copied from `SKILL.md` into shipped source. It is guidance read by
agents, in the same position as `ui-ux-pro-max`.

---

### Skills vendored into `.agents/skills/`

Two more agent skills sit in `.agents/skills/`, and until 2026-10-04 neither
was recorded here nor carried its licence. Both licences were read from the
source repositories' own `LICENSE` files (`CLAUDE.md` #18) and copied in
verbatim; nothing from either enters shipped source.

| Licence copy | `.agents/skills/react-doctor/LICENSE` — added 2026-10-04, as its MIT terms require                      |

**The modification matters.** On top of MIT, Million Software's licence
requires prior written permission for two uses: using the software, or work
derived from it, as training, fine-tuning or evaluation data for a machine
learning model or AI system, and selling it, or offering it as a paid hosted
service whose value comes substantially from it. Reading the skill as
guidance is neither; feeding this repository to a training pipeline would
reach it.

## 4. Sources cleared for code reuse — not yet drawn from

Licences verified; nothing has been copied from these yet. Any future
extraction must be recorded in §6 with the file it landed in.

| Source                          | Licence                                                 | Verified from               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `basementstudio/scrollytelling` | **MIT** — Copyright (c) 2023 basement.studio            | `LICENSE`                   |
| `DavidHDev/react-bits`          | **MIT + Commons Clause** — Copyright (c) 2026 David Haz | `LICENSE.md`                |
| Codrops / tympanus.net demos    | **MIT**                                                 | published policy, see below |

**react-bits — the Commons Clause restriction, read in full.** The licence
grants use "as part of an application, website, or product" including
commercial use, and forbids selling, sublicensing, or redistributing "the
components themselves — whether alone, in a bundle, or as a ported version."

Using a react-bits component in a commissioned client site is permitted.
Shipping a component library derived from it, or reselling the components, is
not. That distinction is compatible with this project, but note that
`vault/` is a component collection by design — if `vault/` were ever
published as a product in its own right, react-bits material would have to be
excluded.

**Codrops — licence comes from a site policy, not a per-repo `LICENSE` file.**
Individual Codrops demo repositories generally carry **no** `LICENSE` file.
The MIT grant comes from the published policy at
https://tympanus.net/codrops/licensing/, verified on 2026-08-29: demos and
code are MIT, commercial use explicitly permitted, copyright and permission
notice must be included. (Design _freebies_ are separate terms — usable in
commercial projects, but redistribution or sale of the item itself is not
permitted.)

Because the grant is a site policy rather than a file in the repository,
**every Codrops extraction must record the demo URL, the article, and a link
to the licensing page in its file header and in §6.**

### Magic UI — moved out of this list in Tahap 47

|              |                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source       | https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui                                          |
| Registry     | https://magicui.design/r/registry.json — 250 items, 78 UI components              |
| Licence      | **MIT**, Copyright (c) Magic UI                                                   |
| Verified     | by reading that repository's own **`LICENSE.md`** — HTTP 200, 2026-09-05          |
| Drawn into   | `vault/magic/` — see §6                                                           |
| Working note | `vault/magic/README.md` — the five mandatory transformations, and the reject list |

**A correction to this document's own earlier record.** The row above used to
sit in the table at the top of this section and read _"Verified from
`LICENSE`"_. That file does not exist:

```
LICENSE.md  → HTTP 200
LICENSE     → HTTP 404
```

The licence is real and the verdict was right, but the filename was wrong,
and a provenance record that names a file nobody can open is a record nobody
can re-check. Anyone following §7 rule 1 to the conventional path would
conclude the repository ships no licence and stop. Corrected here rather than
left, for the reason §6 gives about the sentence it had to retract in Tahap
43: a document that lies about its own sources is worse than no document.

**What "MIT" buys and what it does not.** Copying is permitted provided the
notice travels with the copy, which is what the per-file headers in
`vault/magic/` are for. It does not make the code fit: this project resets
Tailwind's `--color-*`, `--spacing-*`, `--font-*` and `--breakpoint-*`
namespaces to `initial`, so a Magic UI component pasted unmodified renders
**unstyled**. Every file goes through the five transformations in
`vault/magic/README.md` first, and
`lib/styles/scripts/vendor-rules.test.ts` is what makes that a gate rather
than a habit.

**Read the source, not the registry metadata.** Measured in Tahap 47 across
27 components: `dot-pattern` is listed with no dependencies and its source
imports `motion`. One disagreement in 27 is enough to make the metadata
unusable as evidence for the other 51.

## 5. Studied, never copied — no licence, all rights reserved

These repositories are public but ship **no `LICENSE` file**. Verified on
2026-08-29 by requesting `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` on both `main` and
`master`: all four returned HTTP 404.

| Repository                           | Result                           |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `basementstudio/website-2k25`        | no LICENSE on `main` or `master` |
| `basementstudio/basement-laboratory` | no LICENSE on `main` or `master` |
| `brunosimon/folio-2019`              | no LICENSE on `main` or `master` |

**A public repository without a licence is not open source.** Default
copyright applies: no right to copy, modify, or redistribute. GitHub's Terms
of Service permit viewing and forking _within GitHub_; they do not grant a
licence to reuse the code in a separate commercial project.

> **Correcting a claim from the research that fed this project.** Web sources
> asserted that Bruno Simon's `folio-2019` (Awwwards Developer Site of the
> Year 2019) is MIT-licensed. **It is not.** Both branches were checked
> directly; there is no licence file. Had that claim been taken at face
> value, copyrighted code would have entered a commercial deliverable.

**Zero lines from these repositories are in this project.** What was taken
is architectural observation — which is not copyrightable and is recorded in
`references/`. Reading a dependency list and noting _that_ a studio renders
3D in a worker thread is research; copying how they wrote it is infringement.

The same applies to the closed-source award sites measured in `TEARDOWN.md`
(Lusion, By-Kin, Uncommon Studio, Mat Voyce, Minh Pham, Iventions, Lando
Norris). Measuring publicly served CSS to learn that a site uses
`cubic-bezier(.165,.84,.44,1)` at 400 ms is observation of a design decision.
Design decisions — a duration, a curve, a colour relationship, a grid — are
not protected expression. Their code, markup, fonts, and assets are, and none
of it is here.

## 6. Vault extraction log

Every file in `vault/` must appear here, and must carry a header comment with
the same information.

Current status, corrected in Tahap 43 and extended in Tahap 47: `vault/` is
**almost entirely original work written for this project**, built against the
public APIs of MIT/Apache dependencies (Lenis, GSAP, Tempus, R3F) and
following patterns documented in those projects' own docs. Where a file
implements a technique observed elsewhere, the header names the source of the
_idea_ and states explicitly that no code was copied.

**The exceptions are the rows above, and they are stated rather than
glossed.** This section read "No third-party source has been copied" until
Tahap 43, when `vault/primitives/icon` copied seven Phosphor path
definitions. That sentence would then have been a document lying about its
own code — the failure mode this project has already caught eleven times in
`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` — so it was corrected in the same commit as the copy.

Tahap 47 opened `vault/magic/` as a deliberate, gated channel for a second
source. The distinction the log turns on is the same one MIT turns on:
**whether bytes were copied.** Two of the three rows say yes, one says no,
and the third says no because rewriting it was cheaper _and_ better —
upstream's implementation is 5,130 SVG nodes where one `<pattern>` does. A
file logged as "adapted from" would have told a reader neither thing.

The licence was verified by reading `LICENSE` in `phosphor-icons/core`
itself (MIT, Copyright (c) 2023 Phosphor Icons), and separately in
`phosphor-icons/react` (MIT, Copyright (c) 2020 Phosphor Icons) — the
package that was **not** installed. Neither was taken from a badge or an
article, per §7 rule 1 and `CLAUDE.md` #18.

**Why the paths rather than the package.** `e2e/route-budget.e2e.ts` allows
`/en/work`, `/en/work/[slug]` and `/en/ai` no JavaScript beyond the
framework. Installing an icon library to draw seven glyphs would have spent
a budget two stages were spent defending; MIT permits the copy provided the
notice travels with it, and the notice is in the file's header as well as
here.

## 7. Adding anything new — the checklist

1. Find the actual `LICENSE` file in the source repository. Do not trust a
   README badge, a blog post, an article, or a search result.
2. Read it — check for added conditions (Commons Clause, NOTICE requirements,
   non-commercial terms).
3. No licence file → **do not copy.** Study only.
4. Record it here **and** in the file's header comment.
5. If the licence requires attribution, retain the notice verbatim.

When a licence is ambiguous, the answer is not to copy. Judgement calls on
someone else's copyright are the user's to make, not mine — this is
commissioned commercial work and the exposure lands on them.
