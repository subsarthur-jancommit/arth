# DEPLOYMENT

How to take this site from a clone to a live domain. Written to be followed
top to bottom without prior knowledge of the codebase.

Two hosts are covered: **Vercel** (recommended first, and what the build is
tuned for) and **a VPS** (for later, when you want to own the machine).

For the studio's own day-to-day work — adding artwork, editing the home page —
see [`PANDUAN-STUDIO.md`](./PANDUAN-STUDIO.md) instead. It is written in
Indonesian and never asks anyone to open a terminal.

## 0. Before anything — the security bit that matters most

**Use a Viewer token in production, not a developer or editor token.**

The site needs a Sanity token for exactly one thing: reading _draft_ content
so the Presentation tool can preview unpublished work. Reading published
content needs no token at all — the `production` dataset is public.

**Since Tahap 10 that is a narrower job than it sounds.** The home page, the
work catalogue and the project pages are all statically prerendered and read
only published content, so Presentation previews _published_ edits live
(through webhook revalidation) but no longer previews unpublished drafts of
them. What the token still covers is drafts of `page` documents. The reasoning
is in `docs/stages/TAHAP-10.md` §1.2; the practical effect is that the site is
fully usable with no token at all.

A Viewer token can only read. A developer or editor token can **write and
delete your entire content library**. If the server is ever compromised, that
difference is the whole story.

Create one at **manage.sanity.io → your project → API → Tokens → Add token**,
role **Viewer**.

> **If a token has ever been pasted into a chat, an issue, a screenshot, or a
> commit — revoke it.** Same screen, delete and create a new one. Rotating is
> free and takes a minute; assuming it was fine is the expensive option.

**Never give a write-capable token a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.** That prefix
inlines the value into the JavaScript sent to every visitor's browser. It is
not a leak that shows up in testing — the site works perfectly while publishing
your credentials. `lib/integrations/sanity/env.ts` documents this too.

> **This paragraph used to read "Never give a token a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix",
> full stop, and the codebase did not obey it.** There is exactly one
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_` token here and it is deliberate:
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` feeds `browserToken` in `next-sanity`'s
> `defineLive`, and a browser token that cannot reach the browser does nothing.
> A rule stated more absolutely than the code follows is a rule that gets
> ignored wholesale the first time someone notices the gap, so it is narrowed
> here to the thing that actually matters.
>
> **The narrower rule now has a gate**, which the absolute one never could:
> `lib/env.ts` refuses to start when that variable holds the same string as
> `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` or `SANITY_PRIVATE_TOKEN`, and
> `lib/env-guard.test.ts` asserts the refusal fires rather than assuming it.
> Prefer `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` (server-only) unless you specifically need
> browser-side draft preview — and put only a **Viewer** token in either.

## 1. Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local work. `.env.local` is gitignored
and must stay that way.

### Required

| Variable                        | Value                    | Notes                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` | `az53j4l1`               | Public. Safe in the browser. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`    | `production`             | Public.                      |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`          | `https://yourdomain.com` | **No trailing slash.**       |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is not cosmetic. It drives canonical URLs, `hreflang`,
the sitemap, and social images. **On Vercel it may stay unset:** the site then
uses the project's production domain from Vercel's own
`VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` — the shortest custom domain, or the
`*.vercel.app` alias when there is none (`lib/base-url.ts`). Set it when the
canonical domain should be one Vercel does not know yet. On any other host,
leave it unset and the build warns, then publishes `localhost` URLs to search
engines.

### Recommended

| Variable                   | Value              | Needed for                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN`   | a **Viewer** token | Draft preview of `page` documents |
| `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` | a random string    | The publish webhook (§4)          |

Despite the name, `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` is only ever read — it is the
variable name the starter looks for. Put a Viewer token in it.

Generate the webhook secret with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Optional

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` (defaults to `2025-03-01`) and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID`.

## 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push the branch to GitHub, then **Add New → Project** on Vercel and import
   the repository.
2. Framework preset **Next.js**. Leave build and output settings alone — the
   repo's `vercel.json` and `next.config.ts` already carry what is needed.
3. Add every variable from §1 under **Settings → Environment Variables**.
   Apply them to Production _and_ Preview, or previews will read no content.
   Keep **Automatically expose System Environment Variables** on: the base
   URL falls back to `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`, and the colophon's
   build stamp names `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` (`vault/blocks/build-stamp`).
4. Deploy.

### Immediately after the first deploy

**Add your domain to Sanity's CORS allowlist**, or the Studio will load and
then fail every request with an opaque network error:

manage.sanity.io → project → **API → CORS origins → Add origin**

- `https://yourdomain.com` — tick **Allow credentials**
- `https://your-project.vercel.app` — for preview deploys

This step is the single most common reason a correct deployment appears
broken.

### 2.1 Point the domain at it — Porkbun to Vercel

Do this after the first deploy succeeds on the `*.vercel.app` URL, not before:
a domain pointed at a project that does not build yet just fails in a place
that is harder to read.

**On Vercel first, not Porkbun first.** Project → **Settings → Domains → Add**,
and add **three** names:

| name            | what it is                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arth.<domain>` | the site. Or the apex, if you want the site at the bare domain |
| `www.<domain>`  | add it and let Vercel redirect it to the canonical one         |
| `lab.<domain>`  | the sandbox surface (`docs/DIREKSI.md` §5)                     |

Vercel then shows the exact DNS records to create. **Those values are the
source of truth — not this document, and not any other guide.** Vercel has
changed its published record values before, and a guide that copied an old one
is the most common way a domain ends up pointing at somebody else's project
for hours. Copy them from the screen you are looking at.

What it will ask for has this shape, so you know what you are reading:

- an **A** record on the apex (`@`), pointing at an IP Vercel names
- a **CNAME** for each subdomain (`arth`, `www`, `lab`), pointing at a Vercel
  hostname

**In Porkbun:** domain → **DNS** → delete the parking records Porkbun added at
purchase (they will otherwise fight yours), then add the records exactly as
Vercel printed them. Propagation is usually minutes; Vercel's Domains screen
tells you when it sees them, and issues the certificate itself.

### 2.2 Why `lab` is added now, before there is anything on it

There is no `/lab` route yet — that is Tahap 67. The domain is added now
anyway, because DNS is work you would otherwise do twice, and until the route
exists `lab.<domain>` simply serves the same site. Nothing breaks.

The decision it encodes, with its cost stated: **one Vercel project, two
domains** — not a second project. A second project would mean two builds, two
sets of environment variables and two deployments for every commit, and since
both surfaces share `vault/`, every primitive change would have to ship twice.
The cost of one project is the honest one: a lab experiment ships alongside
the main site. That is exactly why `docs/DIREKSI.md` §3.1's correctness gates
apply in full on `/lab`; only the taste gates are relaxed there.

`lab.<domain>` starts being its own thing when `proxy.ts` learns to map it, in
Tahap 67.

One consequence worth knowing before you see it and read it as a bug:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is a single value baked in at build time, so every page
served on `lab.<domain>` will carry a canonical, `hreflang` and `og:url`
pointing at the main domain. That is the correct answer while the two serve
the same content — one canonical, no duplicate-content split — and it is why
`e2e/canonical-sweep.e2e.ts` keeps passing. It becomes wrong the day `/lab`
has content of its own, and Tahap 67 owns fixing it.

---

## 3. Check the deploy is actually right

Run these against the live domain. Each one catches a different real failure.

```bash
SITE=https://yourdomain.com

# Root must redirect to a locale, not serve a page
curl -sSI $SITE/ | grep -i "^location"          # expect /en

# Both languages render
curl -sSo /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" $SITE/en
curl -sSo /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" $SITE/id

# hreflang present, and pointing at the real domain (not localhost)
curl -sS $SITE/en | grep -o '<link rel="alternate" hrefLang[^>]*>'

# Sitemap lists both locales, with the real domain
curl -sS $SITE/sitemap.xml | grep -o '<loc>[^<]*</loc>'

# The CMS loads
curl -sSo /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" $SITE/cms
```

If `hreflang` or the sitemap show `localhost`, the build found neither
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` nor Vercel's system variables. Set the first (or turn the
system variables on) and redeploy — the values are baked in at build time.

---

## 4. Publish webhook (so edits appear without a redeploy)

Without this, published changes only show up on the next deploy.

manage.sanity.io → project → **API → Webhooks → Create webhook**

| Field       | Value                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| URL         | `https://yourdomain.com/api/revalidate`     |
| Dataset     | `production`                                |
| Trigger on  | Create, Update, Delete                      |
| HTTP method | `POST`                                      |
| API version | `v2025-03-01`                               |
| Secret      | the same `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` from §1 |

The route verifies the signature and returns **401** on a bad one, and **503**
if the secret is not configured — so a misconfigured webhook fails loudly
instead of silently doing nothing.

---

## 5. Deploying to a VPS later

> **Status, so nobody reads this as the plan: it is not.** `infra/` holds a
> complete set of GCP provisioning and bootstrap scripts, written and then
> **frozen** in Tahap 62. The VPS was cancelled once the machine was actually
> measured — `bun run build` peaks at **3.35 GB RSS** and takes **74.9 s**, and
> a site that is almost entirely prerendered never needed an always-on box to
> serve it. Vercel's free tier does the job for nothing. The scripts stay
> because the measurements in them are real and this section still promises
> the route; `infra/README.md` says the same at its head.

The app is a standard Next.js server. Nothing here is Vercel-specific except
`@vercel/analytics`, which no-ops when `VERCEL_ENV` is unset. There is
deliberately no `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.ts` — that is a VPS
packaging mode, and adding it would only cost Vercel builds size.

```bash
bun install
bun run build
bun run start          # listens on :3000
```

Put nginx or Caddy in front for TLS and proxy to `:3000`. Run it under
systemd or PM2 so it restarts on reboot. Set the same environment variables in
the service definition — **not** in a file inside the web root.

Two things Vercel did for you that you now own:

- **Image optimisation** runs on your CPU. Watch memory on a small instance.
- **Caching.** `next start` has no CDN in front of it. Add one, or accept that
  every request reaches the origin.

---

## 6. Pre-launch checklist

### Credentials

- [ ] Production token is **Viewer** role, not developer/editor
- [ ] **Rotate the development token.** The token in `.env.local` was pasted
      into a chat during development and is write-capable (developer, editor,
      contributor, viewer). It has **not** been revoked — that was deliberately
      deferred while the site was still being built with it. Revoking is one
      screen: manage.sanity.io → API → Tokens → delete, then create a Viewer
      token for production. Do this before the domain goes public.
- [ ] No token sits behind a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable
- [ ] `.env.local` is not committed (`git ls-files .env.local` returns nothing)

### Configuration

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` set, no trailing slash, and the site **rebuilt**
      after setting it — it is baked in at build time
- [ ] Domain and preview domain added to Sanity CORS, credentials allowed
- [ ] Publish webhook configured and returning 200 on a test publish

### Content and identity

- [ ] Real contact email replaces `studio@arth.example` (in Sanity's **Studio**
      document, and in `lib/seo/site.ts` for the JSON-LD fallback)
- [ ] Real social profile URLs added to `SITE.sameAs` in `lib/seo/site.ts` —
      it ships empty on purpose, because a guessed handle asserts that someone
      else's account belongs to the studio
- [ ] The studio has published a **Studio** document, so the home page shows
      its own words instead of the placeholder copy
- [ ] Share card checked by actually looking at it: open
      `https://<domain>/opengraph-image.png`. Regenerate with
      `bun run brand:assets` if the studio name changed.

### Gates

- [ ] `/` redirects to `/en`; `/en` and `/id` return 200
- [ ] `sitemap.xml` and `hreflang` show the real domain
- [ ] Every sitemap URL matches that page's own canonical and `og:url`
      (`e2e/canonical-sweep.e2e.ts` asserts this; run it against the deploy if
      you want belt and braces)
- [ ] `bun run check`, `bun run build`, `CI=true bun run test:e2e` all pass

## 7. Known limitations, stated plainly

**`script-src` allows `'unsafe-inline'`.** The Content-Security-Policy is
otherwise tight — `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, `form-action 'self'`,
and Sanity origins scoped exactly — but inline scripts are permitted. This is
the upstream starter's default and what Next.js needs without nonce plumbing.
It weakens XSS protection. Tightening it means adding a nonce, and is worth
doing before handling anything sensitive. The policy is composed in
`lib/integrations/csp.ts`.

**The `production` dataset is public-read.** Anyone who knows the project ID
can query published content. For a portfolio that is fine — the content is
public anyway — but do not put anything private in it.

**No performance measurement has been done.** Every performance figure in this
repository is a budget, not a profiler result. See `docs/RESOURCES.md`.

**The build needs Sanity to be reachable.** The catalogue, the three discipline
views and every project page are prerendered from the CMS at build time, so a
transient network failure fails the whole build rather than degrading one page.
It happened once during Tahap 10 (`HTTP 503 — DNS resolution failed`) and
passed on a retry. If a deploy fails with a Sanity 503, retry it before
investigating anything else. This is the direct cost of those pages being
static and cacheable, and it was taken deliberately.

**Renaming a schema field orphans the data in it.** Tahap 13 renamed three:
`discipline` → `practice`, `medium` → `engagement`, `dimensions` → `scope`. The
dataset held only fixtures at the time, so the migration was
`seed-fixtures.ts --clean` followed by a reseed. **On a dataset with real
content that is not enough** — Sanity keeps the old keys and the queries stop
finding them, so the fields read as empty rather than erroring. A real rename
needs a migration (`sanity migration create`), run before the deploy that
changes the schema.

**`sanity schema extract` refuses to overwrite, and `typegen` does not care.**
The extract exits non-zero when `schema.json` already exists, but
`bun run sanity:typegen` is a separate script — run one after the other by
hand, types are generated from the **previous** schema and `tsc` passes on a
shape that no longer exists. `sanity:extract` now passes `--force`, which is
the correct behaviour for a generated file. Found in Tahap 13 by watching the
extract fail and the typegen succeed in the same terminal.

**A rebuild alone does not pick up a content change — the build cache has to
go with it.** Pages under `'use cache'` keep their fetch results in
`.next/cache`, and `next build` reuses that cache. Measured during Tahap 12a:
the CMS held six projects, the rebuilt site served three, and nothing warned
about it — the build log was green and listed the _old_ slugs. Deleting
`.next/cache` and rebuilding brought all six through.

This does **not** affect a normal edit-and-publish cycle, which is what §4's
webhook is for: `/api/revalidate` invalidates by tag and the running server
picks the change up in seconds, no build involved. It matters in two places:

- **locally**, after seeding or changing fixtures — clear `.next/cache`, or
  you will spend an hour debugging a page that is simply the previous build;
- **on a host that restores the build cache between deploys** (Vercel does),
  where a deploy that changes _only_ content can serve the previous content.
  Redeploying without the build cache is the fix.

**The first request to a project URL that does not exist returns `200`, not
`404`.** The static shell is flushed before the CMS lookup resolves, so the
status line is already sent when `notFound()` runs. The response does carry
`<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`, which is what a crawler acts on, and
every subsequent request to the same URL returns a real `404`. Measured, not
assumed — `docs/stages/TAHAP-10.md` §3b has the numbers.
