# RESOURCES

Curated dossier for this project. Everything here was verified on
**2026-08-29** by reading the source directly — repository `LICENSE` files,
`package.json` manifests, and live production CSS — not from articles or
search summaries.

Licence status for every entry is in `docs/PROVENANCE.md`. The short version:
**if the licence was not verifiable, the code does not enter this repository.**

## 1. The foundation

### Satūs — `darkroomengineering/satus`

The base of this repository. MIT, v3.0.0, commit `8cdce31`.

Not a tutorial template: it is the production starter of **darkroom.engineering**,
the studio that wrote **Lenis** — the smooth-scroll library measured on
three of the ten award sites in `TEARDOWN.md`, including two we did not
choose for that reason.

What it brings, verified from its `package.json`:

```
next 16.3.3 · react 19.2.8 · typescript 7.0.2 · tailwindcss 4.3.3
gsap 3.15 + @gsap/react · lenis 1.3.26 · tempus · hamo
@react-three/fiber 9.7 · @react-three/drei 10.7 · three 0.185 · postprocessing 6.39
@theatre/core + @theatre/studio · zustand · zod · @base-ui/react
storybook 10 · playwright 1.62 + @axe-core/playwright · oxlint/oxfmt
react-compiler · next-sanity · @vercel/analytics
```

Why it is the right base, beyond the dependency list:

- **WebGL sits behind a feature flag** (`lib/webgl` + `lib/features`) — the
  starter already treats 3D as an accent, which is the architecture this
  project wants.
- **Design tokens are real and enforced.** `lib/styles/colors.ts` is authored
  in `oklch()`; `contrast.test.ts` fails the build if a palette change breaks
  WCAG AA. Accessibility is checked, not claimed.
- **Its easing tokens are the award vocabulary.** `--ease-out-quart` is
  exactly the curve Minh Pham ships 60×; `--ease-out-expo` is exactly Lando
  Norris's. See `TEARDOWN.md` §1.
- **Storybook + Playwright + axe-core preinstalled.**
- **Agent infrastructure included** — `AGENTS.md` (28 KB of engineering
  standards), `@storybook/addon-mcp`, `deslop-cli`, and a custom oxlint
  anti-slop plugin.

**As pruned here:** kept Sanity, WebGL, Theatre; removed Shopify, HubSpot,
Mailchimp, the example routes, and the starter's own landing page. Done with
the starter's own `setup:project` script so the registry, CSP composer, env
schemas, and barrel exports stayed consistent. 13 dependencies dropped.

## 2. Cleared for code reuse

Licence verified; nothing extracted yet. Any extraction gets logged in
`PROVENANCE.md` §6 and in the file header.

| [`basementstudio/scrollytelling`](https://github.com/basementstudio/scrollytelling) | MIT (basement.studio 2023)                                     | Declarative React + GSAP scrollytelling from an award agency. Closest licensed thing to how these sites choreograph scroll.         |
| [`magicuidesign/magicui`](https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui)                 | MIT                                                            | Animated component patterns. Useful as reference; most need retokenising to our system before use.                                  |
| [`DavidHDev/react-bits`](https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits)                   | MIT + **Commons Clause**                                       | Animated React components. Usable in a client site; **may not be resold or redistributed as components.** See the constraint below. |
| [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/)                                            | MIT via [site policy](https://tympanus.net/codrops/licensing/) | 500+ technique demos. Per-demo repos carry **no** `LICENSE` file — the grant is the site policy, so every extraction must cite it.  |

**The react-bits constraint, because `vault/` is a component collection.**
The Commons Clause permits commercial use inside "an application, website, or
product" but forbids selling or redistributing "the components themselves —
whether alone, in a bundle, or as a ported version." Using a component in the
commissioned site: fine. Publishing `vault/` as a component library: would
require excluding anything react-bits-derived. Worth knowing now rather than
at publication.

## 3. Studied, never copied

No `LICENSE` file → all rights reserved. Architectural notes in `references/`,
zero lines of code.

| Source                               | Note                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `basementstudio/website-2k25`        | Production source of an award agency site. Dependency list is a fact sheet on what such a site needs — `@react-three/offscreen` above all. |
| `brunosimon/folio-2019`              | Awwwards Developer Site of the Year 2019. **Widely and wrongly reported as MIT — it is not** (`PROVENANCE.md` §5).                         |
| `basementstudio/basement-laboratory` | Experiment collection.                                                                                                                     |

Closed-source award sites — Lusion, By-Kin, Uncommon Studio, Mat Voyce, Minh
Pham, Iventions, Lando Norris — measured in `TEARDOWN.md` from publicly
served CSS. What makes them read as expensive is art direction and timing
discipline, and both are legal to learn from.

This row used to say profiling was impossible because the browser here could not reach the network.

What is missing is the work, not the capability. |

### Considered and skipped

**`everything-claude-code`** (68 agents, 286 skills, MIT) — too broad. The
context cost outweighs the marginal gain over the four above. Revisit if a
specific need appears.

## 5. Reading the docs in this repo

| Document                  | Read it when                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AGENTS.md`               | **First.** Engineering standards, code style, framework specifics. |
| `CLAUDE.md`               | Project-specific hard rules for agents. Short by design.           |
| `docs/TEARDOWN.md`        | You want evidence for a design decision. Real measured numbers.    |
| `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`   | Choosing colour, type, spacing, grid.                              |
| `docs/MOTION-SPEC.md`     | Writing any animation. Reference, not law — see `CLAUDE.md`.       |
| `docs/PROVENANCE.md`      | Adding a dependency or copying any external code.                  |
| `references/`             | Architectural context from projects we may not copy.               |
| `docs/teardown-data.json` | Checking a claim in `TEARDOWN.md` against raw counts.              |

## 6. Known gaps

Stated plainly rather than left to be discovered.

1. **No licensed typeface.** Every measured award site self-hosts a
   commercial face (Aeonik, Apercu, Söhne, Maisonneue, ABC Arizona). No free
   substitute reads the same. This is the highest-leverage upgrade available
   and it is a purchasing decision, not a technical one.
2. **No real performance measurement.** The browser could not reach the
   network from this environment. Every performance number here is a budget,
   not a result.
3. **Runtime motion of the reference sites was not observed.** The CSS
   harvest cannot see GSAP timelines or scroll choreography. Statements about
   those are labelled as inference in `TEARDOWN.md`.
4. **Art direction is not decided.** Accent colour, typeface, and voice are
   deliberately open — the system is built to accept them.
5. **GSAP plugin licensing is settled**, and is no longer a gap. Checked
   2026-09-18; `PROVENANCE.md` §2 carries the terms and the correction — the
   plugin list this entry used to cite was itself wrong, naming a `Draggable`
   the source has never imported.
6. **One end-to-end test is flaky against the dev server, and only there.**
   `e2e/not-found.e2e.ts` asserts the 404 page logs no console errors. Under
   `bun run dev`, Next's on-demand route compilation sometimes races its
   `instant` prefetch validation for the homepage, logging
   `Route "/[...slug]": Could not validate 'instant'…`. Against a production
   build — which is how `playwright.config.ts` runs the suite when `CI` is set,
   and how it was verified here — the full suite passes 17/17 with zero console
   errors, repeatedly. Reproduce the CI path locally with
   `CI=true bun run test:e2e`. This is a dev-server artifact, not a defect in
   the page; it is recorded rather than papered over, and the test was left
   asserting exactly what it should.
