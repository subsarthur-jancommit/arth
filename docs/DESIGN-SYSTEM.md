# DESIGN SYSTEM

Token contract for this project. Numbers are grounded in measured production
CSS from ten award-winning sites (`TEARDOWN.md`), and mapped onto the token
system Satūs already ships rather than replacing it.

**Where the tokens actually live** — this document is the rationale; these
files are the source of truth:

| Concern                     | File                                                     |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Colour                      | `lib/styles/colors.ts`                                   |
| Typography                  | `lib/styles/typography.ts`                               |
| Layout / grid / breakpoints | `lib/styles/layout.mjs`                                  |
| Easing                      | `lib/styles/css/easings.css`                             |
| Generated CSS variables     | `lib/styles/css/root.css` (generated — do not hand-edit) |
| Barrel                      | `lib/styles/index.ts`                                    |

Editing a token means editing these files, then letting
`bun run setup:styles` regenerate. Hardcoding a value in a component is a
defect, not a shortcut.

## 0. The dials are retired — the fork

Tahap 34 took three numbers from `.claude/skills/taste-skill/` (MIT, provenance
in `docs/PROVENANCE.md` §3) and made them gate every layout, motion and
density decision: `DESIGN_VARIANCE 7`, `MOTION_INTENSITY 9`,
`VISUAL_DENSITY 3`. VARIANCE was held below 8 specifically to exclude
masonry; DENSITY was held at 3.

This section's own text conceded the problem: the numbers were **"intent, not
measurement. No gate can prove a page 'is at VARIANCE 7'."** A ceiling nobody
can measure is a ceiling on imagination and nothing else, so under
`docs/FORK.md` they no longer gate anything. Masonry is not excluded. Density is
not held at 3. The skill stays vendored and may be consulted; it has no
authority.

What the dials were reaching for still matters, and it is judged the way the
fork judges everything: by looking at the page.

### The design read, corrected

The old read described _"a commissioned-work studio site for clients and
curators, in a monochrome gallery language."_ That is what the site began as.
It is now **an agency site whose motion is what brings a client in** —
`CLAUDE.md` says so, and the three practices (consulting, AI and data,
commissioned work) are the subject. The monochrome palette is still the
default; it is not a law.

### A result worth keeping — Tahap 43

Where `DESIGN_VARIANCE` was actually spent, it was measurable even though the
dial was not. At 1440x900 the six works sat at **two** distinct `x` values and
**three** distinct `y` values, every card 691 x 919 to the pixel.
`work-constellation` gave the catalogue three editorial offsets cycled by index
and two parallax distances (4 and 9), and the page went to **six** distinct tops
with the columns drifting against each other.

`e2e/exploratory-layer.e2e.ts` still asserts that no two cards ever overlap at
any of twelve scroll positions. That one stays: overlapping cards hide the work,
which is a reader problem, not a taste one. Its clauses that _mandated_ variance
are a separate matter (`docs/FORK.md` §2, step 5).

### On the skill's own example

Tahap 34 refused the skill's example `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16,
1, 0.3, 1)` for breaking three rules at once. Two of them — the 300ms default
and the raw bezier — are retired. The third still holds, for a reader's
reason rather than a taste one: `transition: all` can animate layout
properties, and `CLAUDE.md` #4 is about the jank that causes.

## 1. Colour

### The rule this project follows

**Two warm neutrals, and no chromatic accent at all.**

That is a deliberate departure from what `TEARDOWN.md` measured, and the
reasoning is written out in full in `docs/stages/TAHAP-1.md` §0. The short
version: every site in the measured set is a creative or technology studio
whose content — code, type, 3D — carries no colour of its own, so the accent
_is_ the identity. This site shows commissioned artwork. The work is the
colour, and an accent beside it competes with every image on the page.

> **The rule stands; half of the sentence above expired. Tahap 66.**
>
> "This site shows commissioned artwork" stopped being the whole truth at
> Tahap 60: ARTH is an agency (`DIREKSI.md` §1), which puts it in **the same
> category as all seven sites `TEARDOWN.md` §3 measured** — and every one of
> them ships exactly one accent. On basement.studio it is the most-declared
> colour on the site. So the argument as written no longer separates this
> project from the set it was arguing against.
>
> Put to the repo owner at Tahap 66 with that correction, and **re-affirmed:
> strict monochrome stays.** The half of the reason that survives is the half
> that was always the stronger one — every project plate still carries its own
> colour, so an accent beside them competes with every image on the page,
> whatever sector the studio is in.
>
> Recorded rather than quietly edited, so the next reader does not re-open a
> settled decision on finding its stated premise out of date. Zero tokens
> changed; `contrast.test.ts` untouched.

Two independent sources in this repo say the same thing:

- the **Museum/Gallery** palette in `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max` sets
  `Accent` to the _same value_ as `Primary` — a gallery has no chromatic
  accent;
- its **Portfolio Grid** pattern states the strategy outright: _"Neutral
  background (let work shine). Accent: Minimal."_

The measured finding that survives unchanged is the one about grounds:
**pure `#000` on `#fff` is rarer than you would expect at this level.** Lando
Norris ships `#111112`/`#f4f4ed`, Minh Pham `#0d0d0d`, By-Kin
`#242527`/`#f4f2ed`. That small offset is disproportionately responsible for
looking deliberate rather than default, and the values below keep it.

### The chosen values

Locked in Tahap 1 (`docs/stages/TAHAP-1.md`):

| Token   | Value                   | ≈ hex     | Role                |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| `ink`   | `oklch(0.17 0.006 66)`  | `#110f0d` | dark ground / text  |
| `paper` | `oklch(0.964 0.006 92)` | `#f4f3ef` | light ground / text |

Both carry a small warm bias — hue ~66° and ~92° at very low chroma. A pure
grey reads as unconsidered; this reads as paper and pigment. The shift is
subtle enough that no image placed on it picks up a cast.

### The two-theme structure

Satūs shipped `light`, `dark`, and `red`. **`red` is gone** — it described a
theme no page applied, and with no chromatic accent it described nothing.

| Theme   | `primary` | `secondary` | `contrast` |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `light` | paper     | ink         | ink        |
| `dark`  | ink       | paper       | paper      |

Semantic roles (`var(--color-primary)`) are the default, because they are what
theming switches — a literal stays the same colour in both themes. That was
`CLAUDE.md` #9; it is retired as a rule in the fork, and a literal is allowed
when a design wants one. One fact stands regardless: **there is no longer any
palette literal to reference by name:** `--color-black`,
`--color-white`, `--color-red`, `--color-blue` and `--color-green` no longer
exist, so `bg-black` and friends are dead classes that silently do nothing.
Tahap 1 §3 lists every component that had to be corrected because of it.

### `contrast` is a role, not a third colour

Components use `--color-contrast` for interactive state: focus rings, checked
boxes, switch fills, form errors. Filling that role with the ink itself gives
a focus ring **17.24:1** against its ground — WCAG 2.2 asks 3:1 for non-text
indicators. The token stays so a future brand colour can be introduced in one
place without touching every component.

### Authored in oklch, and that matters

`lib/styles/colors.ts` uses `oklch()`. darkroom's production site uses `lab()`
with `color-mix(in oklab, …)`. Perceptual colour space is not theoretical:
tints and shades derived in sRGB lose chroma and go muddy, while oklch keeps
them consistent. That is why the existing variations are derived with
`color-mix(in oklab, …)` — it is good advice rather than a requirement since
the fork retired `CLAUDE.md` #10, and a hand-picked colour is allowed when it is
the right one. Six tokens in `global.css` are derived this way — `--surface`,
`--surface-2`, `--line`, `--line-strong`, `--text-muted` and `--hero-wash-to`
— every one of them a `color-mix(in oklab, …)`. `contrast.test.ts` parses
those recipes out of the stylesheet and pins the list, so a seventh cannot
arrive without a contrast decision attached to it.

### Contrast is enforced, not assumed

`lib/styles/scripts/contrast.test.ts` measures every role pair in every theme
and ratchets in both directions — a new failure fails, and an _improved_ pair
that is still recorded in the baseline also fails, so the baseline cannot go
stale.

Current state: **11 role pairs measured in both themes, 22 measurements, all
clear WCAG AA.** The lowest is `muted text on primary` in the dark theme at
**9.08:1** against a 4.5 minimum; the lowest APCA is **|Lc| 60.6**, on the
same pair, against a 60 threshold. Both numbers come from the table
`lib/styles/css/global.css` keeps beside `--text-muted`, which is where the
75% mix was chosen. `contrast-baseline.json` is empty:

```json
{ "accepted": {}, "apcaAccepted": {} }
```

**Run the test after any palette change.** If a new colour fails, fix the
colour or record a deliberate baseline with `bun run contrast:accept` — never
silence the test.

### If a brand colour is added later

It goes in `themes.*.contrast`, in one place. Before it ships, it must clear
4.5:1 as text on **both** grounds or be restricted to non-text use — the
previous accent failed that test at every lightness of its hue (peak 4.19:1
on these grounds, 4.41:1 even on pure white), which is why it is gone.

### 1.4 The one material: grain

The system has exactly one texture, and it exists because a large flat field
of a single colour is the cheapest-looking thing a screen can show — and this
site has several by design. It is `vault/magic/noise-texture`, rendered once
per page by `components/layout/theme` and again inside the hero, over the
WebGL wash.

**The rule that makes it a material rather than a tint: it must not move the
ground.** Grain is variance around the declared colour; a layer whose mean
differs from the ground is a wash wearing a texture's name. Tahap 55 found
exactly that defect shipped — the layer was a #4d4d4d veil, and it pulled
paper down 11 levels and lifted ink 4.5, which on a two-neutral palette means
the two colour modes were sliding toward each other.

| what           | measured                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| mean shift     | **0 by construction**, ±2 enforced by the gate |
| texture, light | sd **2.4** of 255 (`opacity: 0.7`)             |
| texture, dark  | sd **1.6** of 255 (`opacity: 0.45`)            |
| gate           | `e2e/palette-integrity.e2e.ts`                 |

The two opacities differ because the amplitude is in absolute levels and the
same absolute step reads harder on ink than on paper. They are texture
strengths and nothing else: `opacity` cannot move the ground here, which is
what "one material" is supposed to mean.

Adding a second texture is a design-system change, not a page decision.
Restraint is what `docs/TEARDOWN.md` measured as the difference between a
competent site and an award one, and a second grain would make this one
decoration.

---

## 2. Typography

### Restraint is the whole technique

Measured: **Lusion ships an entire award-winning site on weights 400 and 500.**
Iventions runs on 500 and 300. Variety comes from size, spacing, and case —
not from weight count.

**Rules**

- **Two families.** A display face and a mono. A third only with a reason.
  Locked to **Syne + Geist Mono**.
- **Two to three weights.** More than three is a smell. The scale below uses
  400 / 600 / 700.
- **The mono is not decoration.** On Lusion, basement.studio, By-Kin and
  darkroom the mono carries labels, captions, and metadata. It is what makes
  a site read as engineered.

### Why Syne

`Syne` was drawn for **Synesthésie**, a French art centre, and is widely used
in contemporary-art contexts. That provenance is the point: this site sits
around artwork, and a face from the art world reads as belonging there in a
way a general-purpose UI sans does not.

It replaced **Geist**, which Tahap 1 v1 chose because basement.studio ships
it. Geist is a fine face, but it is a neutral technology sans — and
neutrality is what this site cannot afford once the palette gives up its
accent. With no colour carrying identity, the typography has to.

Both families ship a variable `wght` axis (Syne 400–800, Geist Mono 100–900),
so `fonts.ts` declares no explicit `weight`: one file per family covers every
weight the styles use.

### The scale

From `lib/styles/typography.ts` (mobile → desktop):

| Style     | Family  | Size     | Weight | Line-height | Tracking |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| `h1`      | display | 38 → 120 | 700    | 85%         | −0.04em  |
| `h2`      | display | 32 → 48  | 600    | 90%         | −0.025em |
| `p-big`   | display | 16 → 20  | 400    | 125%        | −0.02em  |
| `p`       | display | 12 → 14  | 400    | 125% → 120% | −0.01em  |
| `caption` | mono    | 11 → 12  | 400    | 125% → 120% | −0.01em  |
| `cta`     | mono    | 12 → 14  | 400    | 100%        | −0.01em  |
| `link`    | mono    | 12 → 14  | 400    | 125% → 120% | −0.01em  |

The split is the design: **display carries what is read** (headings, prose),
**mono carries what is scanned** (captions, labels, calls to action).

Three details are deliberate and should not be "fixed":

- **Display line-height below 100%.** Sub-100% leading on large type is the
  signature of considered typography. Default 1.5 on a 120px heading looks
  like a document, not a design. 85% rather than 80% because Syne has taller
  forms than the neutral sans it replaced — at 80% the lines collide.
- **Negative tracking that scales with size.** −0.04em at h1, −0.01em at
  body. Large type needs tightening; small type needs air. A single global
  letter-spacing is wrong at both ends.
- **`caption` is 11px on mobile, not 8px.** The previous scale shipped 8px
  and carried a written flag saying it was below any readable floor. A flag
  is not a fix. 11px still reads as metadata, and is legible.

### Fluid sizing

Use `clamp()` with a **small viewport coefficient**. Lusion's real
declarations: `clamp(.875rem, 1vw, 2rem)`, `clamp(1rem, 1.5vw, 3rem)`, and
for display `clamp(7em, 8vw, 20em)`.

Body-scale text: **1–1.5vw**. Aggressive `vw` scaling makes text lurch on
resize and is a reliable amateur tell. Display type may scale harder.

---

## 3. Layout

### Grid

Satūs (`lib/styles/layout.mjs`), which matches what the award sites ship:

```
columns:  mobile 4  /  desktop 12
gap:      16px
safe:     16px  (page edge inset)
```

Lusion's column-width formula, verbatim from its production CSS:

```css
--grid-space: calc((100% - 11 * var(--grid-gap)) / 12);
```

**Always `minmax(0, 1fr)`, never bare `1fr`.** Measured on Lusion,
basement.studio and By-Kin. Bare `1fr` refuses to shrink below content width
and causes overflow with long words or wide media — the bug that produces
horizontal scroll on mobile.

### Breakpoints

Satūs uses a single `dt: 800`. That is deliberate and has good company:
Lusion concentrates on one breakpoint (812px, 130×). Custom-built award sites
cluster on 768/1200; Webflow sites carry 479/767/991 because Webflow ships
those, not because anyone chose them.

**Mobile-first. Add a breakpoint only when a layout genuinely breaks** — not
per device category.

### Spacing

**Spacing is a multiple of 4**, and 8 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 96 / 128 is
the preferred subset.

Both halves of that sentence are load-bearing, and the second half used to be
the whole rule. Tahap 37 read the histogram before enforcing it:

```
 8 x51   16 x51   12 x39    4 x32   24 x31   20 x30   32 x18
 6 x16   48 x15   10 x15    2 x13   96 x9    28 x8   160 x8   ...
```

12 ships 39 times and 20 ships 30 times — an author following this system for
36 stages, repeatedly needing the step between 8 and 16 and between 16 and 24,
which the named ladder cannot express. Forcing 69 of those to move would have
shifted real pixels on real pages to satisfy a ladder written before the site
existed. The multiple-of-4 rule rejected the twenty-nine-arbitrary-values
problem outright, enforced by `lib/styles/scripts/scale-rules.test.ts` until the
fork deleted it (`docs/FORK.md`). The ladder is now the default, not a gate.

**Below one step is not spacing.** 1, 2 and 3px are hairline alignment and
optical inset — a switch's inner padding, a tab's baseline nudge. Rounding a
2px inset to 4px doubles it. The grid governs steps.

**Radius, elevation.** Both were born in Tahap 37 because neither existed:
nineteen distinct `border-radius` declarations and six hand-written
`box-shadow`s, all six of the latter inside Base UI wrappers and none in a
`vault/` block — the shape of a system that never decided it had elevation.
`--radius-hairline|sm|md|lg|full` and `--shadow-sm|md|lg`. Radii are fixed
pixels, not scaled: a corner is an edge treatment, not a measure of space.

**Whitespace is the cheapest expensive-looking asset there is.** The most
common failure in "almost premium" work is sections that are too tight.
Generous vertical rhythm between sections costs nothing and does more for
perceived quality than any component.

---

### Hero height, per route — and the rule that decides it

Measured on the production build at 1440×900, after Tahap 49–52:

| Route             | Declared                                  | Measured | Of the screen |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------: | ------------: |
| `/`               | `100svh`                                  |    900px |          100% |
| `/studio`         | `calc(100svh - var(--header-height))`     |    780px |           87% |
| `/practice/<v>`   | `70svh`                                   |    630px |           70% |
| `/work/<slug>`    | content                                   |    857px |           95% |
| `/journal`        | `calc(56svh - --header-height - padding)` |    352px |           39% |
| `/work`           | `calc(48svh - --header-height - padding)` |    280px |           31% |
| `/journal/<slug>` | none                                      |        — |             — |

**The last column is not the rule.** Two of these numbers look small and are
not: on `/work` and `/journal` the height is written as a _subtraction_, and
the thing being measured is where the page's subject lands, not how tall its
masthead box is.

#### The rule

> A hero's height is a share of the **screen**, and the page's own top padding
> is inside that share. Where the page's subject is a list, the height is
> chosen so the first item crosses `useReveal`'s line — 75% of the viewport —
> on load.

It is written that way because the naive spelling was shipped twice and
measured wrong twice. `min-height: 60svh` on `/work` (Tahap 51) put the first
cover at **98%** of a 900px screen; the same value on `/journal` (Tahap 52) put
the first entry at **84%**. Both sat below the page's top padding
(`--header-height` + 80px, clearing the fixed header) and above whatever the
page puts between the masthead and its subject — 194px of filter and count on
`/work`, 48px of section lead on `/journal`. `60svh` was 60% of the screen only
in isolation.

So the two routes carry different numbers — 48 and 56 — and that is not an
inconsistency: what they have in common is the outcome, the first cover at 66%
and the first entry at 60–62%. `e2e/first-screen.e2e.ts` holds it, at both
widths, and it asks whether the page opens on **what it is about**: only a
route whose subject is its list belongs there. `/practice/<v>` has a grid and
is not about it — its subject is the statement, which is why that route is
absent from the gate and its 70% hero is correct.

#### Two more holders, and they are easy to miss

`first-screen.e2e.ts` is the loudest but not the only one. Tahap 60 swept the
e2e suite for height limits, read only that file, and wrote down "no gate
limits hero height" — which is false, and `docs/stages/TAHAP-61.md` §4.1
records the correction. Two others bind:

| gate                               | holds                           | what it demands                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~~`e2e/project-detail.e2e.ts`~~    | `/work/<slug>`                  | ~~the fact `<dl>` intersects an **800px** fold~~ — **retired by the fork** |
| `e2e/navigation-landing.e2e.ts:95` | `/practice/<v>`, `/work/<slug>` | the `h1` lands on the first screen after a navigation                      |

**The first no longer binds, and this document used to claim it did.** It
argued the 800px fold was "not taste" and would stay; the fork retired exactly
that demand and kept the reader-protecting half. `FORK.md` §2 step 5 records
it: what left `project-detail` was "daftar fakta wajib memotong lipatan
1280×800"; what stayed is 404, axe, sitemap, locale and spine. So
`/work/<slug>`'s 95% is no longer a ceiling set by a gate.

What still binds is the second, and it is a rule about a tall hero's
_contents_ rather than its height — grow the hero all you like, but the
headline cannot ride down with it, or a morph arriving from another page has
nothing on screen to morph into. That one is not taste, and it stays.

`svh` and never `vh`, everywhere: `vh` includes the collapsing mobile toolbar,
so a `vh` block is taller than the visible viewport on first paint.

## 4. Motion

`MOTION-SPEC.md` is the reference, not the owner — `CLAUDE.md` demoted it, and
the binding motion rules are `CLAUDE.md` #4–#7. What still binds: `transform`
and `opacity` only, `prefers-reduced-motion` mandatory and content left fully
visible under it, one RAF loop, and cleanup on unmount.

What this section used to also demand, and no longer does. Kept here only so
an old citation still resolves — none of these is a rule any more.

| #   | was                                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | easing only from `--ease-*` tokens, never a raw `cubic-bezier()` |
| 2   | no bare `ease` / `ease-in-out`                                   |
| 3   | durations 200 / 400 / 1000 ms by band                            |

Pick a duration and a curve by looking at the result on a screen. The reasons
are in [`FORK.md`](./FORK.md) §1.1.

---

## 5. Imagery and WebGL

- `next/image` for all raster imagery; never a bare `<img>` for content.
- **Always reserve space.** CLS from an unsized image undoes every other
  quality signal on the page.
- **Always ship a non-WebGL path**, and let no page depend on WebGL to be
  usable or readable; dispose geometries, materials and textures on unmount
  (`CLAUDE.md` #14, #15). The fallback should look intentional, not broken.

  What this bullet used to demand, and no longer does — retired rule **#13**,
  "3D is an accent, kept behind a feature flag". Three.js may be used anywhere
  now; the reader-protecting half of that rule is what survives above, as #14.
  `FORK.md` §3 has the reasoning.

- Bruno Simon's fully-3D site loads **2 scripts**; Iventions loads 36. WebGL
  is not what makes a site heavy — script sprawl is. Guard the script count
  before blaming the canvas.

## 6. Component rules

1. **Tokens are the default idiom, not a requirement.** Colour, spacing,
   duration, easing and type read well from tokens, and reaching for one first
   is still the sane move — but a raw value is no longer a defect.

   Rules **#8** ("no hardcoded design values — no raw hex, no `16px`, no
   `400ms`") and **#9** ("semantic tokens only, never literals") were retired
   by the fork, along with **#10** (colour authored only in `oklch()`). Kept
   here only so an old citation resolves; none is a rule any more.

   Two things from that family do still hold, for reasons that are not taste:
   the palette stays the single source of truth for colour, and theme switching
   breaks if a component references a palette literal where a role is meant —
   so `var(--color-primary)` over `var(--color-ink)` remains the right call
   when a component is theme-aware. Judge it by looking, not by a lint rule.

2. **Tailwind v4 utilities first**, CSS Modules when a component needs real
   structure. Both read the same tokens, so they cannot drift.
3. **Every primitive gets a Storybook story**, including its reduced-motion
   state.
4. **Accessibility is not a later pass.** Focus states visible, targets
   ≥44×44px, contrast checked. `@axe-core/playwright` is already installed —
   there is no excuse for guessing.
5. **A sticky or fixed element carries its own ground.** Anything that leaves
   the flow and sits over the page must set a `background-color` from a token,
   because what scrolls under it is not knowable from the component. A
   transparent sticky element has the contrast of whatever happens to pass
   behind it, which on this site includes photographs.

   This is not hypothetical: `project-spine` shipped `position: sticky` with
   no background for thirty stages. At `--desktop` it sits in column 2 and
   never meets artwork, so it measured clean; below 800px the grid collapses,
   the gallery scrolls beneath it, and the page index read **1.48:1** against
   an AA floor of 4.5. Tahap 72.

   The blindness matters as much as the defect. `contrast.test.ts` measures
   token _pairs_ and cannot see composition; axe reports these nodes as
   `incomplete` — not a violation — because it genuinely cannot resolve a
   backdrop of grain, wash and pseudo-elements. So a transparent sticky
   element is invisible to both guards by construction.
   `e2e/contrast-situ.e2e.ts` samples the painted pixels instead.

## 7. Where this document and the code still disagree

Kept here rather than quietly fixed in prose, because a design document that
describes a system nobody built is worse than no document.

**The counts below are generated, not written.** `lib/scripts/design-debt.ts`
scans the repository. `design-debt.test.ts` used to fail `bun run check` when
this block and the code disagreed; the fork deleted that lock, so the block can
now fall behind. Regenerate before quoting it:

```bash
bun lib/scripts/design-debt.ts --write
```

That machinery is Tahap 73, and it exists because of what happened without it.
This section previously claimed seven hand-written stylesheets (there was one),
six per-line exemptions (there are seven), twenty-five component directories
without a story (there were fifteen), and named "five vault blocks" among them
when **all sixteen** had stories. It also pointed both rows at Tahap 45c and
Tahap 46 — stages that had shipped twenty-six and twenty-seven stages earlier.

Nothing had gone wrong in the code. Nothing ever read the numbers again: no
test, gate or script in the repository mentioned `stories.tsx`, and
`manifest:check` counts components, not stories. §6.4 was a rule with no
instrument and this was its debt note with no instrument, in the one document
whose stated job is not to drift.

<!-- design-debt:start -->

```
scale-exempt-file       1 stylesheet(s) hand-write their type
scale-exempt (per line) 7 exemption(s) across 6 file(s)
                        9 marker site(s); 2 cross-reference(s) to another marker
no Storybook story      0 of 55 component directories
                        13 exempt by rule, each with a reason in lib/scripts/design-debt.ts
```

<!-- design-debt:end -->

### What each number means

| Number                    | The debt behind it                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scale-exempt-file`       | A stylesheet that hand-writes type instead of taking §2's scale. The one that remains is `components/ui/not-configured`, which has zero consumers and is scheduled for deletion — the marker names that reason itself |
| `scale-exempt` (per line) | A single declaration off the scale, each carrying its own reason. Most are marks rather than text — a wordmark, a step numeral, the 404's figure                                                                      |
| `no Storybook story`      | §6.4's rule, now with a scope. The directories exempt from it are listed **with a reason each** in `lib/scripts/design-debt.ts`; an exemption that stops being true fails the gate                                    |

### The counting rules

They are in the scanner, and they are there because the old "six" could not be
checked against anything. Nine `scale-exempt:` sites exist. Two read "see the
note on the mobile size above" — the mobile half of one decision, not a second
one. One more is prose _about_ the escape hatch, in backticks, mid-sentence. So
six, seven and nine were all defensible readings of the same repository.

A number with no counting rule cannot be wrong, which is exactly why it cannot
be right either.
