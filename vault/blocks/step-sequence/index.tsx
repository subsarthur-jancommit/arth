/**
 * StepSequence — an ordered passage read against a label that holds.
 *
 * Provenance: original work for this project. No third-party code copied.
 * Built on GSAP ScrollTrigger (see `docs/PROVENANCE.md` §2 on GSAP licensing)
 * and CSS `position: sticky`.
 *
 * ## What it is, and the measurement that produced it
 *
 * Tahap 24 shipped the studio page's "how we work" section as a sticky label
 * beside four steps. The sticky worked exactly as CSS says it should —
 * measured pinned at its offset, 146px, and holding. What it did not do is
 * *last*: the section was 580px tall in a 900px viewport, so the pin held for
 * roughly 200px of scroll and was over before a reader could register that
 * anything had been held.
 *
 * That is the same class of defect as Tahap 21's material layer, which moved
 * correctly and was never met. A held note that resolves inside one screen is
 * not held; it is a coincidence.
 *
 * So two things changed together, and neither works without the other:
 *
 * 1. **The section is given real height** — each step occupies most of a
 *    screen, so the pin outlasts the viewport several times over.
 * 2. **The label is given something to do** — it reports which step is being
 *    read, and the others recede.
 *
 * The second is what makes the first worth its length. A label pinned for
 * three screens saying one unchanging word is worse than no pin at all.
 *
 * ## Why the index is information rather than decoration
 *
 * "Where am I in this sequence" is the only question an ordered passage
 * raises that has an answer, and a reader three screens into a numbered list
 * genuinely cannot see the numbers they have passed. The counter answers it.
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-25.md` §3.1 records the reasoning; the project's rule
 * against numbered markers on unordered lists is the same rule stated from
 * the other side.
 *
 * ## Accessibility
 *
 * The counter and the active title are `aria-hidden`: they are a second view
 * of an `<ol>` that already carries its own order, and announcing "01 / 04,
 * Scope" alongside the list item that says exactly that is duplication, not
 * assistance. The section's own label stays in the tree.
 *
 * Under `prefers-reduced-motion` no trigger is created, nothing recedes, and
 * the counter stands at the first step — every step ends **fully visible and
 * fully opaque**, which the stylesheet enforces rather than leaving to this
 * component's state.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <StepSequence
 *   label={t('processEyebrow')}
 *   steps={steps.map((key) => ({
 *     key,
 *     title: t(`process.${key}Title`),
 *     body: t(`process.${key}Body`),
 *   }))}
 * />
 * ```
