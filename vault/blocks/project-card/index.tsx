/**
 * ProjectCard — one commissioned work in the grid.
 *
 * Provenance: original work for this project. No third-party code copied.
 * Extracted from `vault/blocks/project-grid`, which previously carried this
 * markup inline.
 *
 * ## Why it was extracted
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is the real one:
 *
 * 1. A project detail page and a "next project" footer both need one card
 *    without the grid around it.
 * 2. The inline version carried raw design values — `font-size: 20px`,
 *    `font-size: 12px`, `gap: 12px` — which is a defect under `CLAUDE.md`
 *    rule 8. Every one of those now has a token, and pulling the card out is
 *    what forced them to be used.
 *
 * ## The data shape is the CMS's, not a private one
 *
 * `Project` mirrors `ProjectsQueryResult` from `sanity.types.ts` rather than
 * inventing a card-shaped struct that every caller has to map into. A private
 * shape means a mapping function, and a mapping function is where a missing
 * `alt` or a dropped locale goes unnoticed.
 *
 * ## Accessibility
 *
 * - One link wraps the whole tile: one tab stop per project, and a target far
 *   larger than 44×44.
 * - The heading is inside the link, so the accessible name is the work's
 *   title rather than the URL.
 * - `alt` comes from the CMS (`coverAlt`, required by the schema) and
 *   describes the artwork, not the layout.
 * - Hover and focus-visible share one treatment, so a keyboard user gets the
 *   same affordance as a pointer user.
 * - `data-cursor` is decoration for the custom cursor and conveys nothing the
 *   link text does not.
