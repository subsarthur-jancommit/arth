/**
 * PracticeList — what the studio does, opened one at a time.
 *
 * Provenance: original work for this project. No third-party code copied.
 *
 * ## Why this block exists
 *
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-14.md` §1 measured melius.com and found three gaps. Two
 * were closed by 14a and by the reveal coverage above; this is the third:
 * **content that changes in place**. A page whose sections only scroll past
 * is read; a page where something rearranges under the cursor is used, and
 * that difference is most of what separates the two sites once the motion
 * grammar is equal.
 *
 * The site already shipped `components/ui/accordion` and `components/ui/tabs`
 * and **no page used either** — the same "tooling built and left idle"
 * finding Tahap 12 kept turning up.
 *
 * ## Why native `<details>`, and not that accordion
 *
 * `components/ui/accordion` is Base UI `Collapsible` plus React `Activity`:
 * client-only, so its content exists only after hydration. The home page has
 * a stated exit criterion — readable with JavaScript disabled — from Tahap 3,
 * re-asserted by `e2e/no-javascript.e2e.ts`. An accordion there would put
 * three sections of copy behind a script.
 *
 * `<details>` opens with no JavaScript at all, is keyboard-operable and
 * screen-reader-announced by the browser, and needs no `aria-expanded` to be
 * kept in sync. The pattern is already in this repo at
 * `components/ui/error-view/index.tsx:63`.
 *
 * ## Why nothing here is invented copy
 *
 * The plan for this stage allowed for placeholder prose, marked as
 * placeholder. It turned out not to be needed: `messages/*.json` already
 * carries a real sentence per practice — `workIndex.<practice>Intro`, written
 * in Tahap 13 and used as the masthead of each filtered catalogue. Reusing it
 * means this section says exactly what the rest of the site already says, in
 * both languages, with nothing for the studio to correct later.
 *
 * The panel therefore holds that sentence and a route to the work itself.
 * A disclosure that opens onto invented filler would be worse than no
 * disclosure, which is the roadmap's own rule about empty sections.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * The panel's entrance animates `opacity` and `transform` only — `CLAUDE.md`
 * #4 forbids animating height, and a `<details>` height transition is exactly
 * the tempting violation. The disclosure itself opens instantly, which is
 * also what a control should do; what animates is the content arriving inside
 * the box the browser has already opened.

              The heading lives inside the summary so the disclosure's
              accessible name is the practice, and the document outline still
              has an h3 per practice for anyone navigating by heading.

            {/*
              The summary is this block's pressable noun, not the link inside
              the panel.

              `e2e/interaction-grammar.e2e.ts` walks every `[data-press]` and
              requires it to answer a hover and a press. A control that only
              exists once a disclosure is open cannot answer either — it is
              not hoverable, not focusable, and has no computed transition —
              and marking one there made the gate report three silent nouns
              whose CSS was perfect. The gate was right: a marked noun has to
              be reachable at rest.

              This is also the truer reading. The interaction this block adds
              is *opening a practice*, and the summary is the control that
              does it. The link in the panel is ordinary navigation, styled
              like the rest of the site but not a noun in the grammar.

                The name is carried to the practice's page rather than
                cross-faded away from it.

                Same mechanism as the work card to its detail page: React
                pairs `<ViewTransition>` elements by name, and the paired
                element does not have to be the one that was pressed — the
                link in the panel below does the navigating, this does the
                travelling.

                `ui-ux-pro-max` is explicit that a navigation morphs **one**
                pair and no more ("compounding Flips are hard to time
                correctly"). This is that one pair; the panel's link carries
                no name of its own.
