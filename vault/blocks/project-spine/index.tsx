/**
 * ProjectSpine — where the reader is in a page that is 4.7 screens long.
 *
 * Provenance: original work for this project. No third-party code copied.
 * Composes `vault/motion/use-active-in-sequence`, which was extracted in
 * Tahap 27 for exactly this reason: a mechanism that lives on one page is not
 * a vocabulary, it is an exception.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-40.md` §1: the project page is the site's second-longest
 * and is **one undifferentiated scroll** — 4.7 screens with not a single
 * subheading. A reader has no sense of how much is left or what kinds of
 * thing are below.
 *
 * ## It indexes regions, not chapters, and that is a content constraint
 *
 * The plan for this stage named the rows *Brief · Approach · The work ·
 * Outcome*. Those sections **do not exist**: `schemas/project.ts` gives a
 * project one `body` of Portable Text per locale, so there is no Brief and no
 * Outcome to point at. Writing them would be inventing content, which this
 * project forbids outright.
 *
 * So the rows name the regions the page actually renders — the hero, the
 * prose, the gallery, the way onward — and a row exists only when its region
 * does. A project with no gallery gets no Images row rather than a link to
 * nothing, which is the same class of lie Tahap 39 removed from the filter.
 *
 * **If the studio later writes headings into `body`, this should be rebuilt
 * from those headings.** Regions are the honest answer for the content that
 * exists today; saying so now is cheaper than discovering it later.
 *
 * ## Not a §9.5 moment
 *
 * The spine has no beginning and no end — it is a continuous response to
 * reading position, the third category Tahap 42 will name. The project page
 * spends its one named moment on `project-arrival`; this does not touch the
 * budget, and `e2e/interaction-grammar.e2e.ts` measures that claim.
 *
 * ## Why it wraps rather than sits beside
 *
 * `useActiveInSequence` needs a ref to the element containing the regions,
 * and the page that renders them is a server component. Wrapping is what lets
 * one client component own both the ref and the two-column layout while the
 * regions themselves stay server-rendered and pass through as `children`.
 *
 * ## A link to the section being read
 *
 * Given `copy`, the spine ends with a control that copies this page's address
 * with the section the reader is in — Orientasi, stage 3 — so a reader can send
 * a colleague the outcome rather than the whole case. It sits after the list,
 * never in a row, so the rows still match the regions one for one.
 *
 * ## Where the reader came in
 *
 * A link with a section in it — the one a colleague copied — brings the reader
 * straight to that section, and the spine marks its row with an entrance
 * arrow (`vault/motion/entry-arrow`, the `section-entry` moment) that stays as
 * they read on. The section is read from the address on hydration and on
 * `hashchange`; the server, which never sees a fragment, marks nothing.
 *
 * ## The facts that follow
 *
 * Given `facts`, the spine keeps the case's name and year once the hero's
 * title has left the screen — Tata & Gerak, stage 4, `following-facts`.
 * Halfway down a 4.7-screen page nothing on screen says which work it is.
 * The name takes the place of the index's own label: the label lifts away
 * as the name rises in, in the same cell, so nothing below moves. Desktop
 * only, where the label is shown; `aria-hidden`, because it repeats the
 * page's `h1`; and with no script there is no handover, and the label
 * stays.
 *
 * ## One line on a phone
 *
 * Below the breakpoint the spine is a strip held over the reading, and every
 * line it gains is a line of the case it hides — so its rows never wrap.
 * More than fit scroll sideways, and the current row is brought to the
 * strip's middle as the page moves on: the strip scrolls, never the page.
 * The current row is marked by the header's own rule
 * (`vault/motion/route-marker`, following the current item) sliding under
 * it along the strip's edge, which also replaces the desktop's sideways
 * nudge — in a row of words that nudge only made the gaps uneven. Tata &
 * Gerak, stage 4.
