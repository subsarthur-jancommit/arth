 * Each item arrives inside a dashed form; the form is struck a beat later.
 *
 * Inside a `Reveal`, because the form follows the reveal contract rather than
 * running a reveal of its own. The labels name the parts, not anything the
 * studio made — this shows the motion, not content. Like `Reveal`'s story, it
 * sits below a screen of empty space so the motion happens on scroll.
