/**
 * Which item in an ordered run the reader is currently on.
 *
 * Provenance: original work for this project. No third-party code copied.
 * Built on GSAP ScrollTrigger — see `docs/PROVENANCE.md` §2 on GSAP licensing.
 *
 * ## Why this is a hook and not two copies
 *
 * It was written inside `vault/blocks/step-sequence` in Tahap 25, for the
 * studio page's process. Tahap 27 needed exactly the same behaviour for the
 * journal index, and copying it would have made "which one is being read" a
 * thing this project answers twice, in two files, that could drift.
 *
 * The extraction is also the argument for the effect at all. `CLAUDE.md`
 * closes on restraint applied *consistently*, and a mechanism that lives on
 * one page is not a vocabulary — it is an exception. This is the same case
 * Tahap 23 made about the entrance reveal, made again one level down.
 *
 * ## The reading band
 *
 * `top 60%` → `bottom 40%` is the middle of the viewport: an item becomes the
 * one being read when it reaches where a reader's eye actually sits, not when
 * its first pixel appears at the bottom of the screen. `onEnterBack` reports
 * on the way up too, so the answer is correct in both directions rather than
 * only while scrolling down.
 *
 * ## Reduced motion
 *
 * No trigger is created at all, and the index stays at 0. Consumers must not
 * rely on that to keep content visible — the stylesheet has to promise it, or
 * every item after the first sits at the receded value permanently. Both
 * consumers do this in a `@media (--reduced-motion)` block, and
 * `e2e/motion.e2e.ts` measures it on each.
