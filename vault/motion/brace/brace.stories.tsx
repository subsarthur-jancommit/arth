 * A frame of bays, each racked until its brace goes in and pulls it square.
 *
 * Inside a `Reveal`, because the bays follow the reveal contract. Four bays,
 * the third marked current; the caption names the part, not anything the
 * studio made — this shows the motion, not content. Like `Reveal`'s story, it
 * sits below a screen of empty space so the motion happens on scroll.
