/**
 * PageTransition — route-change overlay.
 *
 * Provenance: original work for this project. No third-party code copied.
 * Built on Next.js's `onNavigate`/`usePathname`, both public APIs.
 *
 * Mount once in a layout, above `{children}`. A panel sweeps up across the
 * viewport when a navigation *starts* and continues off the top once the new
 * route has committed.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // app/[locale]/layout.tsx
 * <PageTransition />
 * {children}
 * ```
 *
 * ## Two bugs this component shipped with
 *
 * Neither was noticed, because it was never mounted. It sat in `vault/motion/`
 * for ten stages, complete with a story and reduced-motion handling, doing
 * nothing (`docs/stages/TAHAP-11.md` §2.4). A component that is never
 * rendered is never wrong, which is the most expensive kind of finished.
 *
 * **It ran at the wrong moment.** The whole cover-then-reveal sequence fired
 * from a `usePathname()` change — and a pathname change is the moment the
 * **new** route has already rendered. The reader would have watched the page
 * they asked for get progressively covered, then uncovered: 1.2 seconds spent
 * hiding the thing they were waiting to see. A transition needs two moments
 * and the App Router publishes only one; `lib/motion/navigation-signal.ts`
 * supplies the other from `onNavigate` on `<Link>`, which fires only for real
 * client-side navigations — never for a modified click, a new-tab click, or
 * an external href.
 *
 * **It cost GSAP to do a job CSS does.** GSAP is mounted per page here
 * (`components/layout/wrapper`), and only the home page opts in — so a
 * GSAP-driven overlay would have animated on exactly one route, which for a
 * transition is the same as none. Turning GSAP on everywhere to fix that
 * would have put ~69KB on every route to move one element along one axis.
 * `vault/motion/README.md` is explicit: reach for CSS before GSAP. This costs
 * nothing and runs on the compositor.
 *
 * ## One axis, and why
 *
 * The panel translates rather than scaling. A scale wipe has to flip its
 * transform origin between the two halves, and a navigation that resolves
 * mid-cover — the common case, since routes here are prerendered and
 * prefetched — would jump as the anchor moved. Translating on one axis has no
 * anchor to move: interrupt it anywhere and the panel simply carries on out
 * of the top.
 *
 * ## Timing
 *
 * Cover is fast, reveal is slower. That is the asymmetry the `ui-ux-pro-max`
 * motion data asks for — *"exit animation should always resolve faster than
 * entrance so back/forward feels snappy"* — and it is also the honest shape:
 * covering happens while the reader is waiting, and every millisecond of it
 * is latency they can feel; uncovering happens once the page is there.
 *
 * Navigation is never blocked on either.
 *
 * ## The failure mode that matters
 *
 * An overlay that covers and never uncovers is a blank screen. Three things
 * prevent it:
 *
 *   - the CSS parks the panel below the viewport, so with no JavaScript at
 *     all the overlay is simply absent rather than stuck;
 *   - `maxWait` uncovers regardless if the route never commits — a cancelled
 *     navigation, a same-route link, a failed fetch. The `ui-ux-pro-max`
 *     guidance names this exactly: *"don't tie the overlay's reveal directly
 *     to data-fetch completion without a max-wait timeout"*;
 *   - the reveal is a single terminal state, so an interrupted cover cannot
 *     strand the panel part-way.
 *
 * ## Accessibility
 *
 * - `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events: none` — the overlay is decoration and
 *   can never trap focus or swallow a click.
 * - Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the overlay removes itself. There is no
 *   "reduced" version worth showing: a full-viewport wipe is precisely the
 *   kind of large-area motion the preference exists to suppress, and the
 *   route change is already communicated by the content changing.
 *
 *   Precisely: it removes itself *on hydration*. `usePreferredReducedMotion`
 *   reads a media query and the server has no media to query, so the markup
 *   is in the server-rendered HTML for every reader — measured, not assumed
 *   (`e2e/motion.e2e.ts`). The CSS `@media (--reduced-motion) { display:
 *   none }` rule is what covers that window, which makes it load-bearing
 *   rather than the belt-and-braces it is labelled as. The panel is never
 *   visible to a reader who asked for no motion; it is briefly present.
 * - Route changes are announced by the browser's own navigation handling; this
 *   component adds no live region, because a decorative wipe should not be
 *   narrated.

     * Never in the same commit as the cover — Tahap 42.
     *
     * The comment below has described this collapse since Tahap 16a: when
     * `covering` and `revealing` land together, the DOM attribute goes
     * straight from `idle` to `revealing` and the cover **never paints**. The
     * fix then was to move the signal to the Navigation API, which fires
     * ~14ms earlier — and that comment says exactly what was wrong with it:
     * *"the two states are far enough apart" is a timing assumption*.
     *
     * Tahap 42 collected on that assumption. Adding a per-frame consumer to
     * the footer — which every route renders — was enough to close the gap,
     * and `e2e/journey.e2e.ts` reported a back navigation reaching
     * `revealing:history` and `idle:history` with no `covering` in between.
     * Isolated by building without the change and re-running: the same probe
     * passed, so it was the timing, not the instrument.
     *
     * A history navigation is supposed to be *dressed* (`MOTION-SPEC.md` §9.4
     * rule 7). One frame is the smallest thing that makes it true rather than
     * likely: the cover has painted by the next animation frame, so the
     * reveal has something to reveal from.
     *
     * A timer, not a `requestAnimationFrame`. The project's own motion gate
     * rejects a bare rAF outside `lib/dev/` and `lib/scripts/` — correctly,
     * since that is how a second loop gets in — and this file already keeps
     * two timers for the other two nets, so the mechanism is the one it
     * already uses. A timer is also the more robust of the two here: rAF is
     * throttled in a background tab, and a navigation started before the tab
     * was hidden would sit covered until it came back.
     *
     * The wait is what is *left* of the minimum, so a cover that has already
     * been up longer than that reveals with no added delay at all — which is
     * the normal case, and the reason this costs nothing on a slow route.

     * React commit, the DOM attribute changes without the intermediate state
     * ever painting, and a browser that starts no transition fires no
     * `transitionend`. The panel then sits at `revealing` — off-screen, but
     * permanently mid-sweep, so the next navigation animates from the wrong
     * place.
     *
     * Observed once during Tahap 16a, with the journey gate reporting it
     * exactly: `hop 3 back: the route overlay was left at "revealing"
     * instead of idle`. Moving the signal onto the Navigation API — which
     * fires ~14ms earlier than `popstate` — removed the collapse that caused
     * it, but "the two states are far enough apart" is a timing assumption,
     * and this is what makes the stranded state unrepresentable instead.
     *

     * declares, so it never pre-empts a transition that is genuinely running.
