/**
 * A prop a block declares is a prop something passes.
 *
 * ## The defect this was written for
 *
 * `vault/blocks/hero` shipped an `index` prop in Tahap 12d — typed,
 * documented, with markup, with CSS (`grid-column: 9 / -1`), and with the
 * measurement that justified it written into the prop's own doc comment. Three
 * separate files described the result as shipped, and `home.heroIndexLabel`
 * sat in both dictionaries waiting for it.
 *
 * **Nothing passed it for fifty-five stages.** Measured on the production
 * build at 1440×900 the night Tahap 67 found it: the home page's first screen
 * carried content from **462 to 836 of 900**, so the top 51% held nothing but
 * ground, and its three text elements ran 1080 / 363 / 178 — the staircase
 * down the left edge that the prop's own doc records Tahap 12 removing.
 *
 * Every gate in this repository was green throughout. They measure what the
 * page *does*: contrast, motion, budget, axe. None of them can see a
 * capability that was never asked for, because an unrendered element is
 * indistinguishable from a design that never wanted one.
 *
 * This is the check that can: a prop with no caller is either a defect or a
 * deliberate default, and this file makes the project say which.
 *
 * ## Why a unit test and not an e2e one
 *
 * The e2e alternative — "the home page's first screen must fill N of 12
 * columns" — is a taste threshold wearing a number. It would pass a page that
 * filled its columns with the wrong thing and fail a deliberately spare one,
 * and picking N is exactly the arbitrary choice the fork removed gates for
 * making. Whether a declared prop has a caller is not a
 * matter of taste, needs no browser, and is the actual thing that went wrong.

 *
 * 1. **Name-based.** Asked whether `index=` appeared anywhere outside the

 * 2. **Idiom-blind.** Missed `{...(x && { portraitAlt })}`, the

 *    `studio-note` prop that has always been passed.
 * 3. **Shorthand-blind.** Missed `<ProjectHero material` followed by a
 *    comment — on the one prop Tahap 58 and 59 spent two stages on.
 * 4. **Quote-confused.** Tracked quotes so a `>` inside a string could not
 *    end a tag, then met prose: "the headline's 9em measure" opens a quote
 *    that never closes. One `<Hero` produced a region **5700 characters
 *    long** and swallowed the rest of the file.
 *
 * A gate that cannot fail on the defect it was written for is worse than no
 * gate: it converts an open question into a false answer. So this one asks a
