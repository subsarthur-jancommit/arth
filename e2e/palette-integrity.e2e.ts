/**
 * The palette a page declares is the palette a page paints.
 *
 * ## The defect this was written for
 *
 * The repo owner ran the site, looked at it, and said: _"Kamu punya 2 mode
 * warna, dan salah satu mode warna malah menyatu dengan latar belakang."_
 * Two colour modes, and one of them merges into its background.
 *
 * It was true, it was site-wide, and no gate could see it. `contrast.test.ts`
 * reads the tokens out of the stylesheet; `visual-substance.e2e.ts` compares
 * an accent region against a bare one. Neither ever asked the simplest
 * question there is — **does the ground render as the colour the palette
 * says it is?** It did not:
 *
 *   light  /en/journal   paper #f4f3ef (244) painted as 232.7   -11.1
 *   dark   /en/studio    ink   #110f0d  (17) painted as  21.6    +4.5
 *
 * The cause was `vault/magic/noise-texture`, whose filter chain produced a
 * mid-grey #4d4d4d veil rather than zero-mean grain, so every ground on the
 * site slid toward one colour — which is exactly what "the two modes merge"
 * looks like from the outside. `docs/stages/TAHAP-55.md` has the derivation
 * and the fix.
 *
 * ## How it measures
 *
 * By photographing the same region twice: once as it ships, once with the
 * grain layer switched off. Subtracting the two removes the page and leaves
 * the layer, which is the only way to attribute a shift to it rather than to
 * whatever text or image happens to be in frame.
 *
 * Two assertions, and both are needed. The first alone would pass if the
 * grain were simply deleted; the second alone would pass on the veil that
 * caused the defect.

/**
 * The sampled region: the right-hand side at mid-viewport, on the desktop
 * project's 1280x720.
 *
 * Deliberately not "an empty patch". Which pixels are empty differs per route
 * and per stage, and a gate that depends on that goes quietly blind the first
 * time a section grows. The subtraction below makes emptiness unnecessary:
 * anything identical in both frames cancels, so content in the frame costs
 * sensitivity and never correctness.

const CLIP = { x: 820, y: 260, width: 420, height: 340 }

/**
 * Where a route needs a different region, and the one route that does.
 *
 * The note above is right that emptiness is the wrong thing to chase, and its
 * prediction held exactly: a section grew. Tahap 83 moved `/journal`'s cover
 * out of the 338px date rail into the reading column, where it now spans
 * 1045x496 and sits squarely under `CLIP`.
 *
 * What it did not anticipate is **what** grew into the frame. Ordinary content
 * cancels in the subtraction, and the note's "costs sensitivity, never
 * correctness" is true for it. A fixture plate does not cancel the same way:
 * `lib/scripts/seed-fixtures.ts` composites gaussian noise at sigma 12 into
 * every plate, so the patch's own variance dwarfs the site layer's, and
 * `sqrt(with² - without²)` — the grain floor — collapses toward zero while the
 * layer is present and working. CI reported it on both locales, through both
 * retries, on the commit that moved the cover.
 *
 * So this is not the gate going blind on an empty patch. It is the gate being
 * pointed at a surface that carries its own grain, which is the one thing it
 * cannot see past. The rail is still bare ground at `SCROLL`: measured at
 * 1440x900, the caption ends at y=284 and no image reaches left of x=370.

 * **0.000**, which is what "these two photographs differ because the page
 * moved" looks like. Subtraction can only isolate a layer between two frames
 * that are otherwise identical.
 *
 * `/en/work` — the catalogue's covers fill the sampled band, so the grain is
 * behind opaque images. Measured: `coverage` 0.10, added grain 0.533. Nothing
 * wrong with the page; the band simply is not ground there.
