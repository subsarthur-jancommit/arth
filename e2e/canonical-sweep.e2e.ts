/**
 * Every URL the sitemap submits must agree with the page it points at.
 *
 * This is the test that did not exist while three defects shipped together,
 * all from the same root cause — a locale-free path handed to a helper that
 * needed a localized one:
 *
 *  - `og:url` said `/work/arus-balik` while the canonical said
 *    `/en/work/arus-balik`. Two URLs for one page, from one function.
 *  - `og:locale` reported `en_US` on every Indonesian page, because the
 *    locale was read from a path that had no locale in it.
 *  - `/en/ai` and `/id/ai` both declared `canonical: /ai` — a URL this app
 *    does not serve, which is worse than declaring none.
 *
 * Every gate stayed green. `lib/seo/alternates.ts` states the invariant in
 * prose ("`path` must be the same URL `app/sitemap.ts` submits") and
 * `alternates.test.ts` checks the helper in isolation, but nothing compared
 * the sitemap to the pages it lists. Doing that is this file's whole job.
 *
 * Driven by the sitemap rather than a hardcoded list, so a new route is
 * covered the moment it is submitted — including CMS-driven ones, which no
 * hardcoded list could know about.
