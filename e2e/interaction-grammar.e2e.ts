/**
 * The interaction grammar, on the page — `docs/MOTION-SPEC.md` §9.
 *
 * ## What made this necessary
 *
 * One command, run against the repository at Tahap 12:
 *
 * ```
 * grep -rn ":active" --include=*.css app components vault lib
 * → 0
 * ```
 *
 * Eighteen stylesheets used `:hover`. Not one element in the site changed
 * when it was pressed, so between "I touched this" and "a new page appeared"
 * the site was silent. On a fast connection that gap is short and reads as
 * expensive; on a slow one it reads as a click that was not received.
 *
 * `MOTION-SPEC.md` §9 answers it with one sentence spoken by every pressable
 * noun — REST, INTENT, COMMIT, TRANSPORT, SETTLE — and this file is what
 * stops that sentence from being a document nobody kept.
 *
 * ## Why the DOM carries the grammar
 *
 * `data-press="<noun>"` marks the control; `data-intent` marks the element
 * that visibly acknowledges hover or focus, when it is not the control
 * itself. Two attributes, so the grammar is inspectable in devtools and
 * addressable from here — a test that had to guess which descendant of a card
 * carries the acknowledgment would be a test that quietly stops checking the
 * moment the markup moves.
 *
 * ## What left this file in the fork
 *
 * Five assertions fixed how the site expresses itself rather than whether a
 * reader is answered, and the fork removed them (`docs/FORK.md`, steps 2 and
 * 5): a list of nouns each route had to carry; COMMIT and INTENT inside a
 * 150–250ms band; every press easing on `transform`; a ceiling on moments per
 * route; and every long movement named. The last two are now printed.
 *
 * What stays is the reader's side of the grammar: a pressable thing answers a
 * press, INTENT reaches the keyboard as well as the cursor, and reduced motion
 * keeps the state change while dropping the transition.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not asserted
 *
 * **COMMIT from the keyboard.** `:active` is used precisely because the
 * platform applies it to Enter and Space on a link or button as well as to a
 * pointer — that is the argument for CSS over a `pointerdown` handler. It is
 * not observable here: Enter on an `<a>` navigates in the same tick, so there
 * is no frame in which to measure the compression. INTENT *is* asserted from
 * the keyboard below, which is the half that can strand a reader.
 */

/**
 * The visual state of one element, as a reader would perceive it.
 *
 * Deliberately wider than the transform.
 *
 * The first version compared `transform`, `scale` and `opacity` only, and
 * reported the header's nav links and the hero's call to action as
 * acknowledging a cursor but not a keyboard. They do acknowledge it — with
 * colour, which is what those two controls change on hover as well. The
 * narrow snapshot was measuring one kind of acknowledgment and concluding
 * something about all of them.
