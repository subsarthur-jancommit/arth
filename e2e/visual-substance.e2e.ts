 *
 * ## The class of defect this exists for
 *
 * Every other gate here reads the DOM, the network, or the source. None had
 * ever looked at where content sits or what a surface renders as, and two
 * defects shipped through that gap:
 *
 *   - **Tahap 17.** The hero's WebGL wash rendered *darker* than the page
 *     behind it — mean luminance 4.0/255 against the ground's 15.5. Every
 *     gate was green. "Is there a canvas" and "does the canvas draw something
 *     worth drawing" are different questions, and only the second one matters
 *     to a reader.
 *   - **Tahap 18.** Every practice page (retired) rendered its content flush against
 *     the viewport edge — `h1` at x=0 while the header's wordmark sat at 14 —
 *     on three routes, both viewports, both languages. Nothing asked where
 *     content starts.
 *
 * ## What this cannot catch
 *
 * Composition. A page can have a correct gutter, a correct tonal range, and
 * still be badly arranged; that judgement needs eyes, and
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-18.md` records the pass that used them. This gate holds
 * the two properties that turned out to be mechanically checkable.

 * How much more modulation a live accent must add over the same page with the

 * left is the accent's own contribution. An absolute floor would have to be
 * retuned for every viewport and would drift between machines.
 *
 * Measured on `/en` at 1280x800 with the pipeline correct: mean 30.2 against
 * 15.5 with the canvas hidden, tonal range 13.9 against 0.0. Before the Tahap
 * 17 fix the same shot gave mean **4.0** — below the hidden arm, which is the
 * defect stated as a number. The margin is set well under the measured
 * headroom so a legitimate retune of the wash does not trip it.
 *
 * **What this number means changed in Tahap 34, and the value did not.** It
 * used to be a margin the band's own spread had to beat; it is now a floor on
 * the accent's *own* contribution, measured by subtracting the two frames
 * (`contribution()` in `lib/styles/scripts/luminance.ts`, which carries the
 * reason). The band-spread form only worked while the band held nothing but
 * the wash, and Tahap 34 moved the headline into it.
 *
 * Re-measured under the new form, same day:
 *
 * | route                       | viewport | contribution range |
 * | --------------------------- | -------- | -----------------: |
 * | `/en` (WebGL wash)          | 1280x800 |           **15.9** |
 * | `/en/practice/<v>` (CSS)    | 1280x800 |           **12.1** |
 * | `/en`                       |  390x844 |            **9.7** |
 * | `/en/practice/<v>`          |  390x844 |            **8.9** |
 *
 * Two of those four rows are history: the CSS-accent route was the practice
 * page, which is retired. The numbers are kept because they are what the
 * floor was derived from, and a floor whose derivation is deleted is a floor
 * nobody can re-check.
 *
 * Three is a floor with real headroom, and it was checked by raising it to 99
 * and watching all four go red — a gate nobody has seen fail is a gate nobody
 * has tested. The mesh out-modulating the CSS fallback is the ordering the
 * design intends, which is a second reason to believe the number.

 * old deadline had been derived from the clipped one:
 *
 * ```
 * viewport   dpr  pixels    full frame        clipped
 * 1280x800    3   9.22 MP   16.4-16.9 s       6.7-7.7 s
 *  390x844    3   2.96 MP    4.3-4.5 s        1.6-1.7 s
 * ```
 *
 * Measured on this project's laptop, four captures each, idle. The 15s
 * deadline that preceded this sat **below** the 16.7s a 9.22 MP frame needs,
 * so the first run after the change failed with
 * `TimeoutError: page.screenshot: Timeout 15000ms exceeded` — the deadline
 * doing its job, on a capture that was not stalled but merely large.
 *
 * So: 45s is about 2.7× the worst measured frame, which covers this laptop
 * running two workers, and the budget covers the whole chain — entrance up
 * to 15s, the region up to 20s, two captures, and the settle between them.
 * A gate that passes still finishes in about 3.5s on the desktop project;
 * these numbers only decide when Playwright gives up.
 *
 * The alternative considered and not taken: dropping the desktop-width
 * variant from the `mobile` project, which is where the 9.22 MP frame comes
 * from. `docs/stages/TAHAP-95.md` proposed exactly that and was withdrawn
 * when CI refuted its premise. Reviving it on a new argument — cost rather
 * than flakiness — is its own decision about coverage, and removing coverage
 * to save time is the riskier of the two moves.
