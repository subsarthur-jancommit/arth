/**
 * The site as one reader moving through it, rather than as a set of pages.
 *
 * ## The class of defect this exists for
 *
 * Every other gate in this repository opens a page with `page.goto` — which
 * always starts at scroll zero, alone, with no history behind it. Nothing has
 * ever tested a reader who *moves*. That is precisely how Tahap 15b's landing
 * defect survived sixteen stages of green gates: every internal navigation
 * carried the previous page's scroll offset, and no gate could see it because
 * no gate ever performed a second navigation.
 *
 * `e2e/navigation-landing.e2e.ts` covers one hop. This covers a sequence, and
 * asserts the invariants that only a sequence can break:
 *
 *   - state that leaks from one navigation into the next (a stranded overlay,
 *     a `view-transition-name` never cleaned up);
 *   - the browser's own history behaviour, which no single-hop test touches;
 *   - whether the sixth navigation still behaves like the first.
 *
 * ## What this cannot catch
 *
 * It samples resting states between hops, not the frames inside them —
 * `e2e/motion.e2e.ts` owns what happens during a transition. And it walks one
 * path; a different order could still surface something this one does not.
