/**
 * The reading progress hairline reports where the reader is.
 *
 * ## Why this is measured rather than trusted
 *
 * `vault/motion/reading-progress` has **two** implementations of one line: a
 * CSS `animation-timeline: scroll()` where the browser has it, and a
 * ScrollTrigger where it does not. Exactly one runs, decided at runtime by
 * `CSS.supports`, so a change to either can leave the other silently doing
 * nothing — the failure mode is a bar that never moves, which looks like a
 * design decision rather than a defect.
 *
 * This asserts the observable: nothing drawn at the top, the full width at the
 * bottom, on every route that carries it.
 *
 * ## And where it must not be
 *
 * Reduced motion removes it (`display: none`), and short pages never had it —
 * a progress bar on a page that is one scroll long is a decoration pretending
 * to be information.
 */

/*
 * `/en/practice/consulting` was the third entry here and is retired. The unit
 * page that replaces it is **not** added: it is one screen long until F3-02
 * gives it content, and this file's own rule is that a progress bar on a page
 * one scroll long is a decoration pretending to be information. Adding it
 * would have turned that rule into its opposite.
