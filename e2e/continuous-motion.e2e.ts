/**
 * Scroll-linked motion, and where it must not go — Tahap 33.
 *
 * ## What left this file in the fork
 *
 * It opened with a floor: `/en/work` and a project page had to render more
 * than three distinct transform "frames" across nine scroll positions, written
 * after the owner judged the site under-animated (the catalogue measured one
 * frame across 4.5 screens). A floor on how much a page moves is a quota on
 * expression, so the fork removed it (`docs/FORK.md`, step 5).
 *
 * What stays protects the reader: prose never drifts against its column, a
 * plate stays where the layout put it under reduced motion, the travelling
 * layer never shows its frame, and the footer strip stops when asked.

     * The rule the parallax preset states and Tahap 23 was right about:

     * reading comfort, and it is the single way this kind of motion goes
     * wrong.
     *
     * `:not(nav *)` since Tahap 40, and the narrowing is deliberate rather
     * than convenient. The rule is about **prose** — the sentence above says
     * so, and names the cost as reading comfort. `main li` was a proxy for
     * that, and it over-matched: `vault/blocks/project-spine` marks the
     * region being read by nudging its row 4px, and the probe reported the
     * nav label "Images" as moved prose.
     *
     * A row in a `<nav>` with an accessible name is a control, not a column
     * of text; nobody reads it the way this rule protects. Excluding
     * navigation makes the selector measure what the comment already claimed
     * it measured. Every paragraph and every list item that is actually
     * content is still in scope.
     */
    /*
     * Sampled twice at the SAME scroll position, and only a transform that is
     * non-identity in both samples **and unchanged between them** counts.
     *
     * ## Why one sample was the wrong ruler
     *
     * The rule is about *scroll-linked* transform. One `getComputedStyle` call
     * cannot tell that from an **entrance** transform still in flight, and this
     * test spent its life reporting the second as the first. Measured on
     * `/en/work/arus-balik` at 1440x900, immediately after the scroll:
     *
     *   t+0ms     matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 32)        opacity 0
     *   t+300ms   matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.499064)  opacity 0.984
     *   t+600ms   none
     *
     * That is `useReveal`'s 32px lift decaying to nothing in about half a
     * second — a reveal the gallery plates are supposed to have. The fixed
     * 600ms wait below lands on the boundary of that decay, so whether this
     * test passed depended on how fast the machine was: green on CI, red on a
     * slower box, with nothing wrong with the page either time.
     *
     * A scroll-linked transform has the opposite signature. Scroll position is
     * its only input, and it has not moved between the two samples, so its
     * value is **identical**. Comparing two samples separates the two cleanly.
     *
     * This is stricter, not looser: a reveal *stranded* at 32px is also
     * constant, so it is still reported — and a stranded reveal is a real
     * defect (`CLAUDE.md` #5) whichever gate names it.
     */
    /*
     * A reveal that has not fired yet is constant too — Tahap 82.
     *
     * The two-sample rule separates an entrance **in flight** from a scroll
     * linkage, and it does that correctly. It does not separate a third thing:
     * an entrance that has not **started**. `useReveal` holds its element at
     * the lift until the trigger is reached, so a plate still waiting reads as
     * `translateY(16px)` in both samples and identical between them — the exact
     * signature this test treats as proof.
     *
     * It went red on CI for precisely that, and the page was right. Measured on
     * `/en/work/pusat-beban`, the horizontal track's fourth plate at eleven
     * scroll positions:
     *
     *   y=0     0 0 0 0
     *   y=716   1 1 1 0        <- three revealed, the fourth still waiting
     *   y=1790  1 1 1 0.95     <- the track brings it in
     *   y=2148  1 1 1 1
     *
     * Nothing is stranded. The plate reveals when the reader reaches it, which
     * is what a reveal is for, and this test samples at one third of the page.
     *
     * So pending reveals are excluded, and that narrows nothing this test was
     * written to catch: a **stranded** reveal is content that never arrives,
     * and `motion.e2e.ts` already holds that line the only way it can be held
     * — by scrolling the whole page first and then demanding every
     * `[data-reveal-item]` be visible. Asking the question here, from one
     * position, could only ever guess.
