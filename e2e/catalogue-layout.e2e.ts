/**
 * The catalogue's filter, and the motion that answers it.
 *
 * ## What left this file in the fork, and why
 *
 * It opened with two layout assertions: every card on `/work` shares one
 * column span, and the home page keeps a mix of spans. Both pinned a
 * composition — the first forbade a catalogue with an editorial rhythm, the
 * second forbade a home page without one — so the fork (`docs/FORK.md`, step
 * 5) removed them. The history that produced them is kept below, because the
 * defect it describes (rows of dead space) is still worth knowing about when
 * the catalogue is redesigned; it is no longer enforced as one layout.
 *
 * ## The layout history
 *
 * ## What this caught, and why nothing else could
 *
 * `ProjectGrid` places each card by the work's own `span` — 6 or 12 of the
 * 12 desktop columns. That is a *composition* choice, made by the studio so a
 * chosen piece runs full width among a handful of neighbours on the home
 * page. Tahap 8 pointed the same block at `/work`, which lists everything.
 *
 * Measured on the built site at 1440px, with three works spanning 6, 12, 6:
 *
 *   card 1   691px wide
 *   card 2  1398px wide   <- cannot sit beside a span-6, so a new row
 *   card 3   691px wide   <- another new row
 *
 * Three rows for three works, two of them carrying ~700px of dead space, and
 * a page 3802px tall. Twenty works would run past 18,000px with the same
 * holes. Every gate passed: axe is clean, nothing overflows, the HTML is
 * complete without JavaScript, the headers are cacheable. It took looking at
 * a screenshot — which is the point `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` keeps making
 * about this project, that a green gate is not a correct page.
 *
 * The fix was `layout="catalogue"`, which gives every card the same column.

/**
 * The filter filters — Tahap 39.
 *
 * ## What was wrong, measured before any of this was built
 *
 * `vault/blocks/practice-filter` renders "All" plus one chip per unit, in
 * a `<nav>`, with `aria-current` on the selected one. It looks exactly like a
 * filter. It was not one:
 *
 *   - `app/[locale]/work/page.tsx` hardcoded the active filter to `null`, so the
 *     `active` prop was **always** `null` — "All" was permanently current and
 *     **no chip could ever appear selected**;
 *   - pressing a chip **left the catalogue** for `/practice/<value>`, a
 *     different kind of page with its own hero and statement;
 *   - the filtered branch of `catalogue.tsx` — the `key`, the
 *     `t(`${practice}Title`)` lookup, the empty state — was **dead code**.
 *
 * A control that looks like a filter, behaves like navigation, and never
 * shows a selected state is a usability failure, and more to the point it
 * lies to the reader.
 *
 * ## Why the selected-chip assertion is scoped to the filter's own nav
 *
 * `aria-current` is not unique on this page. Proving these red caught the
 * instrument before it caught the site: a selector of
 * `nav:has(a[href$="/work"])` matched the **header's** route navigation —
 * which Tahap 38 had just added — and reported the current chip as `Work`,
 * the header's own link. The language switcher carries `aria-current="true"`
 * too.
 *
 * So the filter marks itself with `data-practice-filter`, and this queries
 * that. A test hook rather than a structural guess: the same reasoning
 * `data-statement` and `data-site-facts` already carry elsewhere in this
 * suite, and the alternative is an assertion that passes on the wrong
 * element.
 */
/*
 * The first unit, and its reader-facing label.
 *
 * Spelled out rather than read from `messages/*.json`, because for a unit the
 * two happen to coincide — `konstruksi` and "Konstruksi" — and a test that
 * imported the dictionary to prove the dictionary is what the chip shows
 * would be asserting against itself. `lib/content/units.test.ts` is where the
 * key-to-label agreement is checked.
 *
 * The filter's attribute is still `data-practice-filter`: `vault/blocks/` is
 * a library of the practice-era blocks that the F3 unit templates replace,
 * and renaming its hooks now would be churn with no reader behind it.
 * Recorded in `docs/PROGRES-ARTHUR.md`.
