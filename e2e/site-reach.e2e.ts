/**
 * Whether a reader can get anywhere from where they landed.
 *
 * ## The measurement that produced this
 *
 * Tahap 20 counted the real onward links on every route, at both viewports,
 * separating header, footer and content:
 *
 * | Route                  | onward links in content            |
 * | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
 * | `/en`                  | 12                                 |
 * | `/en/work`             | 11, including three practice chips |
 * | `/en/practice/<value>` | 3                                  |
 * | **`/en/work/<slug>`**  | **1** — the next project           |
 *
 * And on every single route the footer carried **no navigation at all** —
 * an email address and two social accounts. A project page is the one most
 * likely to be a landing page, from a search result or a shared link, and it
 * offered a reader exactly one way onward.
 *
 * ## What left this file in the fork
 *
 * Two assertions answered that table: every route had to link the catalogue
 * and every practice, and every page had to offer at least three onward
 * links from its own content. Both fixed the site's information architecture,
 * and the fork removed them (`docs/FORK.md`, step 5). What stays: the header
 * is not a dead end, a guessed URL goes somewhere, the 404 offers a way on,
 * machines are told what exists, and Studio does not sit on a public path.
 */

/**
 * A URL guessed from a nav label, and where it lands.
 *
 * The mapping itself is unit-tested in `lib/i18n/guessed-paths.test.ts`; what
 * this adds is proof that `proxy.ts` actually runs it, and that the status is
 * a **real 308** rather than the 200 the not-found page is forced to return
 * (`e2e/not-found.e2e.ts` documents why). Middleware executes before
 * rendering, so this is the one layer of the app where a genuine redirect
 * status is available — and an assertion that never checked the status would
 * pass just as happily against a soft 404.

 * claimed the subject moved there, and it did not — Arthur's three units are

   * Every link the site's own chrome renders reaches a page of the site.
   *
   * ## The defect this exists for, measured
   *
   * `site-reach`'s header assertion above matched hrefs by suffix, so
   * `href="/studio"` satisfied "there is a header link to /studio" while
   * serving something else entirely. On the production build, before this:
   *
   * ```
   * curl -s localhost:3000/en | grep -o 'href="[^"]*studio[^"]*"'
   *   href="#studio"
   *   href="/studio"          <- the footer's link to the studio page
   * curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' localhost:3000/studio  ->  200
   * curl -s localhost:3000/studio | grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'
   *   <title>Sanity Studio</title>
   * ```
   *
   * A reader who pressed "Studio" in the footer — the site's only route
   * navigation until this stage — landed on the CMS login. It had shipped
   * that way since Tahap 24, and `docs/stages/TAHAP-15.md` §1.3 had already
   * written down that `/studio` was taken.
   *
   * ## Why the locale prefix is the thing asserted
   *
   * The cause was not a typo. `lib/i18n/paths.ts` listed `/studio` as
   * deliberately locale-free (it was Sanity Studio's base path), so
   * `components/ui/link` correctly declined to prefix it — and a correct
   * refusal to localize is indistinguishable, in the rendered href, from a
   * link that was never meant to be a page. Every page of this site is served
   * under a locale, so an unprefixed href in the chrome is that bug's exact
   * signature, whatever caused it.
