/**
 * Text is readable against what is **actually painted behind it**.
 *
 * ## The defect, and why nothing could see it
 *
 * `vault/blocks/project-spine` is `position: sticky` with no background of its
 * own. At `--desktop` (>= 800px) it sits in column 2 and never meets artwork,
 * which is why it survived every gate and every screenshot for thirty stages.
 * Below 800px the grid collapses, the index becomes a horizontal row pinned
 * under the header, and the gallery scrolls **beneath it**. Measured on the
 * production build at 390x720, `/en/work/arus-balik`, scrollY 1224:
 *
 * ```
 * "Images"    1.48:1     (needs 4.5)
 * "Notes"     1.80:1
 * "Next"      2.68:1
 * "Overview"  2.84:1
 * ```
 *
 * The same four links measure 6.79-7.26:1 at scrollY 612. Nothing about the
 * link changed — only what passed behind it.
 *
 * Three guards were in place and all three are structurally blind to it:
 * `contrast.test.ts` measures token pairs in isolation; axe reports these as
 * `incomplete` rather than violations because it genuinely cannot resolve a
 * backdrop of grain, wash and pseudo-elements; and all 11 `AxeBuilder` call
 * sites read `results.violations` only, so 185 serious `incomplete` nodes were
 * discarded unread. `docs/stages/TAHAP-72.md` §1.
 *
 * ## How this measures it
 *
 * 1. Collect every visible text run with its computed colour and the **line
 *    boxes of its glyphs** — `Range.getClientRects()`, not the element's
 *    border box. Sampling the border box is how a bordered CTA reads 1.00:1:
 *    the border is ink too, and no glyph ever sits on it. That false positive
 *    was this gate's second draft.
 * 2. Make every glyph transparent and screenshot. What remains inside those
 *    boxes is exactly the backdrop — grain, wash, photograph and all.
 * 3. Sample it, composite the ink's alpha over it, and take the **worst**
 *    pixel. Worst rather than mean because a reader reads a whole word: one
 *    pale patch under three letters is where legibility actually fails.
 *
 * The worst-pixel rule is affordable because it was calibrated first: 759
 * desktop runs across seven full pages bottom out at 6.39:1 against a 4.5
 * floor. A 1.4x margin on passing content is what keeps a rule this strict
 * from flickering on grain.
 *
 * Colour is resolved through a canvas rather than parsed. The site authors in
 * `oklch()`, so `getComputedStyle().color` comes back as `lab(...)` or
 * `oklab(... / .75)` — a regex for `rgb()` matches none of it, which is how
 * this gate's first draft reported `Infinity:1` on every route while appearing
 * to run.
