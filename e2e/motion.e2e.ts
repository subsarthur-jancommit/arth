 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` hard rule #5: `prefers-reduced-motion` is mandatory, and under
 * it content must end **fully visible** — never stranded at `opacity: 0`
 * because an animation was skipped. That is the failure this project set out
 * to avoid from the start, and until now nothing checked it: axe does not
 * look at opacity, and the no-JavaScript gate passes precisely because the
 * reveal CSS is scoped under an attribute JavaScript sets.
 *
 * The second half is the opposite risk, and it is the one that actually bit.
 * `vault/motion/page-transition` was written to cover the viewport and
 * uncover it, and shipped with two bugs — it ran from a `usePathname()`
 * change, which is the moment the *new* route has already rendered, and it
 * needed GSAP on routes that do not load GSAP. Neither was noticed because
 * the component was never mounted (`docs/stages/TAHAP-11.md` §2.4). An
 * overlay that covers and never uncovers is a blank screen, so its terminal
 * state is asserted here rather than assumed.

 * and 6, and it does not clear.
 *
 * ## It is not a defect, and the first version of this note said it was
 *
 * The second `<main>` is `display: none`, `0×0`. It is Next's cached
 * navigation tree — the previous route kept for an instant Back — and it is
 * in no accessibility tree, takes no tab stop, and paints nothing. I wrote it
 * up as a duplicate-landmark defect before measuring the box, which is the
 * same mistake this file's other notes describe, made on a framework
 * behaviour instead of on our own code.
 *
 * What it *does* break is a probe that queries the whole document: the two
 * items inside that hidden tree read as `opacity: 0` and get reported as
 * content stranded from the reader. So the probes ask for the rendered
 * `<main>` — the one with a box — rather than the first or last in document

/**
 * A split heading keeps its name.
 *
 * ## What changed in the fork
 *
 * This asserted that the `h1` on six routes enters line by line behind a mask
 * — one entrance, spoken the same way everywhere. That is a uniformity
 * mandate, and the fork removed it (`docs/FORK.md`, step 5): a page may enter
 * however its design wants. What the test also held is an accessibility
 * defect that has shipped here once, and that stays: a heading split for
 * motion must not lose its accessible name.
 *
 * ## The history of the line reveal
 *
 * The `h1` is the first thing read on any page, and until Tahap 23 it entered
 * two different ways: the home hero rose line-by-line behind a mask
 * (`vault/motion/text-reveal`), and every other route got the generic block
 * reveal. The expensive gesture lived on one route and the rest got the
 * default — the exact inversion of the standard `CLAUDE.md` closes with,
 * that the difference between a competent site and an award one is restraint
 * applied *consistently*.
 *
 * ## Why two routes are not in this list
 *
 * `vault/blocks/practice-hero` wraps its `h1` in `<ViewTransition
 * share="morph">` — the practice name travels from the list into its own
 * page, which is the whole of Tahap 15b. SplitText replaces the very text
 * nodes that morph photographs. So that route keeps its own, more expensive
 * entrance, and `MOTION-SPEC.md` §9.5 caps a page at two choreographed moves
 * anyway.
 *
 * **`/en/journal/<slug>` joined it in Tahap 41**, for the identical reason
 * and by the identical mechanism: `journal-transport` carries the row's
 * headline into the entry's `h1`, so that `h1` cannot also be split. The
 * morph **is** that page's arrival, and a line reveal on top of it would be a
 * second arrival competing with the first.
 *
 * Both absences are decisions; this comment is where they are written down —
 * and the test above (`a journal row morphs into its entry`) is what stops
 * the route quietly ending up with neither entrance.
