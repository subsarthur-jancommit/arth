/**
 * What each route costs on its own, and which heavy libraries it is allowed.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is a library list, not only a number
 *
 * A byte ceiling drifts and gets raised. The decision worth protecting is
 * *which* routes pay for three.js, GSAP and the Sanity client — and that
 * decision had quietly stopped holding: `lib/features/index.tsx` documents
 * that "a site that never animates should not pay for it" while
 * `<Wrapper>` passed `syncScrollTrigger` unconditionally, and `<SanityLive>`
 * mounted on every route including the one whose own comment claims it is
 * "server-only end to end" (`docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` §Tier 4).
 *
 * ## Why prefetch is blocked
 *
 * Next warms linked routes, so `/en/work` legitimately downloads the home
 * page's chunks — including three.js — because the wordmark links there.
 * Counting those would make every route look like the heaviest one it links
 * to. Blocking prefetch isolates the route's own graph, which is what the
 * budget is about. Verified: `/en/work` measures 914KB with prefetch on and
 * 737KB with it blocked, and the difference is entirely the home route.
 *
 * ## Why post-idle, not from the markup
 *
 * Tahap 5 budgeted by counting `<script src>` tags in the HTML. Two libraries
 * arrived *after* hydration through `import()` and were invisible to that
 * method. This waits for the network to settle and weighs what arrived.
 *
 * ## Tahap 7's "exactly one route" rule is revoked here, on purpose
 *
 * This file used to carry a stronger claim than a budget: that the material
 * layer lives on **one** route and a second would undo a Tahap 7 decision.
 * The owner of the project has directed that WebGL be extended (scaffold
 * Fase 6, `docs/ROADMAP.md`), so that rule is lifted **explicitly and here**,
 * rather than quietly violated by the stage that needs it.
 *
 * What replaces it is not "anything goes". Every route still declares what it
 * carries, and a stage that adds a library to a route must add it to that
 * route's `allow` list with its reason. The list is the decision; the number
 * is only the ceiling.
 *
 * ## Baseline, measured against the production build in Tahap 22
 *
 * | route                     | measured | budget | headroom |
 * | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ | -------- |
 * | `/en`                     | 1899 KB  | 2100   | 201      |
 * | `/id`                     | 1899 KB  | 2100   | 201      |
 * | `/en/work`                |  871 KB  |  900   | 29       |
 * | `/en/work/arus-balik`     |  866 KB  |  900   | 34       |
 * | `/en/practice/consulting` |  874 KB  |  900   | **26**   |
 *
 * `/en/ai` (706 KB against 850) was measured here until Tahap 84 removed
 * the route; its row and its budget entry went with it.
 *
 * `/en/work` and its project page were 751/746 KB before Tahap 23 added the
 * shared heading entrance; the +120 KB each is GSAP arriving. **No ceiling
 * was raised for it** — see their entry below.
 *
 * **No ceiling was raised in Tahap 22.** Raising a budget for weight that
 * does not exist yet is how a budget stops meaning anything; Fase 6 raises
 * the routes it actually loads, with the measurement that justifies it.
 *
 * The practice route's 26KB is the one to watch: the scaffold's Fase 1 adds
 * motion primitives, and that is where they will land first. A red gate there
 * is this file working, not this file being in the way.
 *
 * ## Tahap 28: this file caught the thing it was written to catch
 *
 * The search palette (`components/ui/command`) is loaded on first open, so no
 * route should have moved at all. Three did — `/en/work` 871 → **914**,
 * `/en/work/arus-balik` 866 → 909, `/en/practice/consulting` 874 → **917**,
 * all over ceiling — for code nobody had opened.
 *
 * The cause was not the palette. It was one import inside it: the palette
 * used `components/ui/link`, which also lives in the header's eager chunk, so
 * webpack duplicated that whole chunk to serve both the eager and the async
 * graph. **~43KB of already-downloaded code, shipped twice.** Neither
 * `next/dynamic` nor `React.lazy` changed it; removing that one import did,
 * and `/en/work` came back to 880.
 *
 * **No ceiling was raised.** The rule this file states — the list is the
 * decision, the number is only the ceiling — held: the fix was to stop
 * shipping the weight, not to permit it. The generalisation is worth keeping:
 * a module shared between an eager chunk and an async one can cost its whole
 * chunk group twice, and the only way to see that is to measure.

   */
  /*
   * The catalogue takes the material layer in Tahap 32, and this is the
   * "says why" that the note above asks of any stage adding a library.
   *
   * **Why:** the home page shows a selection of the work with plates that
   * answer the pointer; this page shows all of it, through the same
   * `ProjectGrid`, and its plates were inert. A visitor who pressed a plate
   * on the home page and then opened the catalogue found the same object had

   * is the largest single number in this file after the home page's. The
   * ceiling is raised to the home page's 2100 rather than to something
   * snugger, because these two routes now carry the same engine for the same
   * reason and a different ceiling on each would be two decisions where there
   * is one.
   *
   * The project owner authorised raising budgets deliberately, and this is
   * what deliberately looks like: measured first, written down here with its
   * reason, and re-gated at the new number. Phones and readers who ask for
   * reduced motion still download no engine at all — `webgl-budget` proves

   * `/en` and `/en/work` already carry this surface at a 2100KB ceiling, and
   * the reason this page joins them is that it is the one that shows a single
   * work at its largest and holds a reader longest: it had the flattest
   * version of the site's own material. The engine is the same engine, loaded
   * the same way — `vault/webgl/material-image` fetches its scene only once
   * it has decided to show it, so a phone and a reduced-motion reader
   * download no engine at all. `e2e/webgl-budget.e2e.ts` proves that

   * Theatre.js — Tahap 46.

   * `lib/dev/theatre` is a development tool: it exists so the Studio editor
   * can bind to a live project while curves are being authored. `@theatre/core`
   * is nevertheless a **runtime** dependency, and `SheetProvider` is imported
   * by `lib/webgl/components/canvas/webgl.tsx`, which every WebGL route
   * mounts — so "it is dev-only" was a property of one `process.env.NODE_ENV`
   * branch and nothing checked it.
   *
   * `docs/ROADMAP.md` claimed this was already guarded here. It was not: the
   * three markers above were the whole list. Adding it is the difference
   * between a dev tool that is believed to stay out of production and one
   * that is measured to.
   *
   * ## The marker took three attempts, and the first two were false positives
   *
   * This is the hard case for a string scan: the wrapper is *named after* the
   * library and mirrors its API, so the obvious markers match the code that
   * exists precisely to avoid loading it.
   *
   * 1. `/theatrejs|@theatre\/core/` reported `/en loaded theatre`. Measured:
   *    one 34KB chunk, one occurrence — `id === "theatrejs-studio-root"`, a
   *    DOM check compiled in from the CSS reset. Plus `lib/dev/theatre` holds
   *    `() => import('@theatre/core')` at module scope, so the module's *name*
   *    sits in the eager chunk as the reference webpack needs to fetch the
   *    lazy one. A marker matching a module's name matches the code that
   *    decides not to load it.
   * 2. `/SheetObject|onValuesChange/` also reported red. Measured: two 39KB
   *    chunks, and the context is `{ onValuesChange, lazy, deps }` — the
   *    options bag of **our own** `useTheatreObject` hook.
   *
   * `createRafDriver` is the library's own export and appears nowhere in
   * `lib/dev/theatre`: 4 occurrences in `@theatre/core`'s dist, 0 in ours.
   * It is only in a fetched chunk when the library itself has been fetched.
