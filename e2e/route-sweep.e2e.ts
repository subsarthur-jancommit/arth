/**
 * Route sweep — auto-discovered smoke coverage for every static page.
 *
 * Why generated beats instructed: a hand-maintained checklist ("add a smoke
 * test when you add a route") rots the moment someone forgets it — and
 * nothing enforces "someone" remembering. This file discovers routes from the
 * filesystem at collection time (below, before any `test()` calls run) and
 * emits one smoke test per route. A new `app/**\/page.tsx` gets coverage the
 * instant the file exists; no instruction to follow, nothing to forget.
 *
 * Prune-safety: discovery is filesystem-derived, so a fork that deletes a
 * route shrinks this sweep automatically — there's no stale entry to clean
 * up, because there's no hardcoded list.
 *
 * What's excluded, and why:
 *  - Dynamic segments (any path segment containing `[`) are skipped. They
 *    need fixture data to render meaningfully (a real slug, a real product
 *    id) and are bespoke by definition — write a dedicated `*.e2e.ts` for
 *    those, the same way `not-found.e2e.ts` covers the `[...unmatched]`
 *    catch-all with real assertions instead of a generic smoke.
 *  - Route groups (`(site)`, `(examples)`) are stripped from the URL — they
 *    don't affect routing, only file organization.
 *  - `OPT_OUT` (below) is an escape hatch for a static route that genuinely
 *    cannot be visited by this smoke (needs auth, needs a running external
 *    service, etc.) — not a knob for "this test is slow" or "this is
 *    flaky." Same spirit as the `// cache-exempt:` comments in
 *    `lib/integrations/cache-invariant.test.ts`: an opt-out requires a
 *    reason, and the reason is visible (here, in the test name).
 *
 * Scaling this past the starter's 3 routes: `fullyParallel` is already on in
 * `playwright.config.ts`, so this sweep is fine well into the dozens of
 * routes at ~1-2s each. Past that, in order:
 *   1. Turn up `--workers` in the CI invocation.
 *   2. Shard with Playwright's `--shard=i/n` across a matrix of CI jobs.
 *   3. Split the axe (a11y) scan out into a nightly full-suite run and keep
 *      the per-PR sweep to the render + console-error assertions — a11y
 *      scans are the slowest part of each iteration.
 *   4. `OPT_OUT` is never the answer to "this got slow." It exists for
 *      routes that genuinely can't be visited, not for pruning a sweep that
 *      takes too long — that means invest in 1-3 above.
 * None of 1-3 are implemented here: the starter has 3 routes, and machinery
 * nothing exercises is the disease this sweep is curing, not a pattern to
 * repeat preemptively.

/**
 * `/[locale]/studio/page.tsx` -> `['/en/studio', '/id/studio']`; returns `[]` for a route
 * with any other dynamic segment.
 *
 * `[locale]` is expanded rather than skipped. Every page in this app now lives
 * under it, so skipping dynamic segments wholesale — as this did before
 * bilingual routing — would discover nothing at all and silently delete the
 * entire sweep. Expanding instead means each page is smoke-tested in BOTH
 * languages, automatically, with no list to maintain.
 *
 * `[unit]` is expanded too, from `UNITS`, for the same reason and with one
 * more: a unit page takes no fixture data — the list in `lib/content/units.ts`
 * *is* its data — so there is nothing to stand up and nothing to skip. A unit
 * added there gets swept without anyone remembering to add it, which is the
 * drift this file exists to catch. `/konstruksi` is also a bare single
 * segment, so a route that stopped answering would otherwise be invisible
 * here and caught only by `proxy.ts` answering it `404`.
 *
 * Other dynamic segments (`[slug]`, `[...slug]`) are still skipped: they need
 * fixture data to render meaningfully and belong in a dedicated spec —
 * `e2e/unit-page.e2e.ts` is the unit pages' own, beyond this smoke.

/**
 * Runs every scroll-triggered reveal to completion, so axe scans a settled page.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second one only appeared in Tahap 9.
 *
 * `use-reveal` fades items in via IntersectionObserver, so anything below the
 * fold sits at `opacity: 0` until it is scrolled to — and an element at zero
 * opacity fails `color-contrast`, because axe cannot tell "will fade in" from
 * "unreadable". Scrolling through first means the sweep covers content that
 * was otherwise never scanned at all.
 *
 * It also removes a race. `page.goto` resolves on `load`, which can land
 * mid-fade, and a half-faded element genuinely has low contrast for that
 * instant. This did not surface before because the home page's content was
 * inside a `<div hidden>` — the Suspense fallback described in
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-9.md` §1 — so axe had almost nothing to look at. Fixing
 * that made the sweep meaningful and flaky in the same commit.
