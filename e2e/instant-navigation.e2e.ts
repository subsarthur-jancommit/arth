/**
 * Instant navigation is a starter default (#259): the 404 page's "Go Home"
 * link is the one real internal navigation in the app, and its shell must
 * paint immediately from the prefetch cache — no waiting on the network.
 * `instant()` (Next 16.3, `@next/playwright`) enforces that by deferring any
 * dynamic data until the wrapped callback returns, so a regression that
 * de-opts the shell (e.g. a `cookies()` read leaking into a shared layout,
 * or a Suspense boundary moved past the fold) fails this test instead of
 * going unnoticed.
