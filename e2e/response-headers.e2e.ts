 * which is how `/en/work/arus-balik` came to be served `no-store` — every view of
 * the most-shared page class hitting the origin — while hashed, immutable
 * build assets were served `max-age=0` and refetched on every navigation
 * (`docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` §Tier 3).
 *
 * The assertions are per class of route rather than per URL, because the
 * classes are the decision: a static page may be cached hard, a page that
 * reads request data may not, and a content-hashed asset is immutable by
 * construction.
