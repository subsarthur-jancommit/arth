/**
 * A control stays a control — rescued from `taste-preflight` in the fork.
 *
 * `e2e/taste-preflight.e2e.ts` was the taste checklist made mechanical: every
 * clause a ceiling on expression, down to banning a punctuation mark in the
 * copy. The fork deleted it (`docs/FORK.md` §2, step 5). One of its clauses
 * was not taste, and it lives here now:
 *
 * **A call-to-action whose label wraps onto two lines is a broken button, not
 * a long label.** The hit area splits, the label reads as two separate
 * things, and on a narrow screen it can push the control past its container.
 *
 * Three changes from the original. The third matters most:
 *
 * 1. **The page is waited on, not timed.** The original slept a flat 1600ms
 *    because "entrance motion is choreographed up to 1200ms". The fork removed
 *    that 1.2s entrance ceiling, so a longer opening is now allowed — and a
 *    flat sleep would photograph it half-lifted. `waitForEntrance` waits for
 *    the curtain to actually clear.
 * 2. **The anti-vacuum works.** The original asserted `counted >= 0`, which is
 *    true of a page with no buttons at all. A reader that measured nothing
 *    would have reported a clean site. The home page has CTAs, so it must
 *    count at least one.
 * 3. **It can now actually fail.** The original measured the element's own
 *    client rects, which are one box for any `inline-block` or flex control
 *    no matter how its label wraps — so it could never go red on the buttons
 *    it named. See `wrappedControls` below.
 *
 * What was **not** rescued, and why: `runs one theme`. The audit suggested
 * keeping it as "disorienting"; a theme that turns over mid-scroll is a
 * technique award sites use on purpose, and whichever theme is showing, its
 * text contrast is still measured by `contrast-situ.e2e.ts`. That is a taste
 * judgement, so it went with the rest of the file.

/*
 * How many lines a control's label actually occupies.
 *
 * **The original check could never fail on a real button**, and that was
 * found while rescuing it. It counted `el.getClientRects().length`, which
 * returns one rectangle per line box only for an *inline* element. The home
 * page's CTA is `display: inline-block`, so it returned 1 whether its label
 * sat on one line or three. `taste-preflight` had been checking a condition
 * that could not occur on the controls it named.
 *
 * Counting a `Range` over the contents is closer and still wrong: it returns
 * one fragment per inline piece, so "Search ⌘K" — a label and a keycap in
 * separate spans — measured 5 on a single line. What a wrap actually changes
 * is the number of distinct **line tops**.
 *
 * And it is counted **per text node** — the second correction. Counted over
 * the whole control, the catalogue's filter chips failed as "3 lines": each
 * chip stacks its label over a small count ("All" above "06") inside a 44px
 * touch target, by design, and the label itself was one fragment on one line.
 * A wrapped label is one run of text broken across lines, not a control built
 * from two stacked parts, so each text node is measured on its own. Tops within
 * `SAME_LINE_PX` are one line: the count's two fragments sat at 505 and 506, a
 * rounding difference that had been scored as a second line.
