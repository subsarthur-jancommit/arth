'use client'

/**
 * A signal that a client-side navigation has *started*.
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist
 *
 * `vault/motion/page-transition` was built in Phase C and never mounted. Read
 * closely, it could not have worked: it ran its whole cover-then-reveal
 * sequence off a `usePathname()` change, and a pathname change is the moment
 * the **new** route has already committed. The reader would have watched the
 * page they just asked for get progressively covered by an overlay, then
 * uncovered again — 1.2s of hiding the thing they were waiting to see. A
 * transition needs two moments, and React Router-style route events do not
 * exist in the App Router.
 *
 * Next 16 supplies the missing half as `onNavigate` on `<Link>`, which fires
 * only for real client-side navigations — never for a modified click, a
 * new-tab click, or an external href. `components/ui/link` announces through
 * this module; `PageTransition` subscribes. Keeping the two apart means the
 * link component knows nothing about animation and the overlay knows nothing
 * about routing.
 *
 * ## Not a React context
 *
 * A context would force every link into the same provider subtree and make
 * the overlay a parent of the whole app. An event on `window` costs nothing,
 * survives any tree shape, and is inert when no one is listening — which is
 * exactly the state under `prefers-reduced-motion`, where the overlay is not
 * rendered at all.

/**
 * How a navigation should be dressed.
 *
 * `cover` is the default: a panel sweeps across and hides the swap, which is
 * right for a link between two unrelated pages.
 *
 * `morph` means the destination shares an element with this page — a work's
 * cover, going from the catalogue card to the project page — and React's
 * `<ViewTransition>` will animate it across. The two are mutually exclusive
 * by construction: a morph is only legible if the reader can *see* both
 * states, and a cover exists precisely to stop them seeing either. Announcing
 * the intent is what lets the overlay stand aside for the handful of
 * navigations that have something better to show.
 *
 * `sheet` is the same page in the other language — Orientasi, stage 4. It is
 * covered like any swap, but the panel crosses sideways, the way the next
 * sheet of one drawing set slides over the last, rather than rising like a
 * new page.

/**
 * What started the navigation.
 *
 * `link` is a press on a `<Link>`. `history` is the browser's own back or
 * forward control — which presses no link, fires no `onNavigate`, and is
 * therefore the reason a back navigation ran no transition at all until
 * Tahap 16a.
 *
 * Deliberately not called `back`. `popstate` fires for forward as well, and
 * distinguishing the two means tracking a history index this module has no
 * business owning. The distinction that actually matters for the treatment is
 * link-versus-browser-control, and that is the one measured.
