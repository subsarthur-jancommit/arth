/**
 * Temporary fixture content, for verifying pages that need real data.
 *
 * **This is not seed data for a real site.** Every document it writes carries
 * an id prefixed `fixture-`, and `--clean` deletes all of them plus the image
 * assets they reference. It exists because two of Tahap 4's exit criteria —
 * an end-to-end test against a real slug, and a sitemap containing every
 * project — cannot be checked against an empty dataset, and inventing
 * permanent engagements in the agency's own content library is not an option.
 *
 * The intended cycle is: seed, verify, `--clean`. Leaving fixtures behind puts
 * work nobody made into a real portfolio, so `--clean` removes the assets too,
 * not just the documents.
 *
 * ```bash
 * bun --env-file .env.local lib/scripts/seed-fixtures.ts
 * bun --env-file .env.local lib/scripts/seed-fixtures.ts --clean
 * bun lib/scripts/seed-fixtures.ts --preview   # render only, no CMS, no token
 * ```
 *
 * `--preview` writes the plates to `.fixtures-preview/` and stops. The plates
 * exist to be judged by eye — that is the whole reason Tahap 12a replaced the
 * gradients — and the round trip of uploading ten assets, rebuilding and
 * reloading a page is a slow way to find out a colour is too dark. It is the
 * only path here that touches neither the network nor a token.
 *
 * Seeding and cleaning require `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN`. Read-only tokens
 * cannot run them, which is the correct failure: they write.

/**
 * One generated plate: a ground, a mass, a light, and a horizon.
 *
 * ## Why a composition and not a gradient
 *
 * The first version of this made two radial gradients over a flat fill. That
 * was enough to prove the image *pipeline* — reserved boxes, derived ratios,
 * the CDN URL builder — which was all Tahap 4 needed.
 *
 * It is not enough to judge a *layout*. A gradient has no subject, no focal
 * point and no direction of light, so a crop cannot be wrong on it and a
 * column cannot be unbalanced beside it. Every composition question this
 * project has left — how tall a hero should be, whether a card's crop keeps
 * the work, which side of a spread carries weight — is unanswerable against a
 * blur. `docs/stages/TAHAP-12.md` §3 measures what that cost.
 *
 * So each plate carries four things a reader's eye can actually use:
 *
 *  - a **horizon**, so the frame has a top and a bottom;
 *  - a **mass** that sits on it, shaded away from the light, so the frame has
 *    a subject;
 *  - a **light** with a stated position, so the frame has a direction;
 *  - one **hard edge**, so a crop is visibly a crop.
 *
 * Still generated, not downloaded: that keeps the script offline, keeps
 * `docs/PROVENANCE.md` out of it entirely (nothing is copied, so nothing needs
 * a licence), and — the part that matters here — lets the aspect ratio be a
 * parameter rather than whatever a stock photograph happens to be.

 *
 * The gallery assets are **shared**: all six works draw their two plates from
 * `plate-wide` and `plate-tall`, in one order or the other. So the honest
 * description is of the plate itself, written once, rather than six
 * paraphrases of the same two pictures. The cover keeps `project.alt`,

 *

 * the three gallery plates the generator makes, and a description written
 * only when something starts using it is a description written under
