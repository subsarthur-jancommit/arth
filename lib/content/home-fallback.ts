/**
 * Placeholder copy for the home page, in both languages.
 *
 * **Every field here loses to the CMS.** The moment a `studioSettings`
 * document exists with a value, that value is used instead — see
 * `resolveHomeContent` below. Nothing in this file is meant to survive
 * contact with the real studio's words.
 *
 * ## Why it exists at all
 *
 * The `production` dataset currently holds zero documents (measured, see
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-3.md` §0). A home page fed entirely from an empty CMS
 * renders with no `<h1>` and almost no text, which fails
 * `e2e/agent-readiness.e2e.ts` and cannot be judged by anyone. The two
 * alternatives were worse: shipping a blank page, or writing invented engagements
 * into the agency's real content library.
 *
 * ## Why it is not in `messages/*.json`
 *
 * `schemas/studioSettings.ts` draws the line and it is worth keeping:
 * `messages/` holds **interface** text — nav labels, button copy — that ships
 * with the code and changes when the code changes. Editorial copy belongs to
 * the studio and must be editable without a deploy. This file is editorial
 * copy that has nowhere else to live *yet*; it is a stand-in for the CMS, not
 * a second home for site copy.
