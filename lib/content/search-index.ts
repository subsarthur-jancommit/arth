/**
 * What the command palette searches, assembled from sources that already

 *
 * ## Nothing here is a new source of truth
 *
 * Every page entry comes from `lib/seo/route-catalog.ts` — the same module
 * that feeds the sitemap and `/llms.txt`, and which already
 * carries a label and a description in both languages because those strings
 * are read by people and by crawlers alike. Projects come from the catalogue's
 * own GROQ query, journal entries from `resolveJournalEntries`. The palette is
 * the fourth consumer of those facts rather than a fifth copy that can drift.
 *
 * That is also why this module takes already-fetched data as arguments rather
 * than fetching anything itself: the fetch belongs to the route handler, with
 * its `'use cache'` boundary, and a pure function is the part worth unit
 * testing.
 *
 * ## The pages it lists are the footer's pages
 *
 * A palette that omits pages the footer offers is a second, quieter site map
 * that disagrees with the first. That argument is why the `/ai` machine view
 * was in here — and why, when Tahap 84 removed that page, it left this index
 * with it rather than lingering as a result that leads nowhere.

/**
 * The index, with the network allowed to fail.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `app/[locale]/search.json/route.ts` already had a fallback for one of the
 * two ways Sanity can be absent — `!isConfigured('sanity')`, the project that
 * never wired a dataset. It had none for the other: **configured, but
 * unreachable.** One TCP reset from `apicdn.sanity.io` during prerender took
 * the whole production build down with it:
 *
 * ```
 * Export encountered an error on /[locale]/search.json/route: /en/search.json,
 * exiting the build.
 *   [cause] Error: read ECONNRESET   errno: -104   attemptNumber: 5
 * ```
 *
 * `attemptNumber: 5` is the Sanity client's own retry counter, exhausted. So
 * re-running the job is not a fix — the client already ran it five times. The
 * fix has to be here, where the caller decides what a missing answer means.
 *
 * ## Why it takes a loader rather than doing the fetch
 *
 * This module's rule, stated at the top, is that it never fetches: the fetch
 * belongs to the route handler with its `'use cache'` boundary. That rule is
 * kept — the loader is injected, so this function is still pure and still
 * unit-testable, and `buildIndex` cannot be called directly from a test
 * because `'use cache'` owns it.
 *
 * ## What a degraded index contains, and why that is the right trade
 *
 * Static page and practice entries only: every route in
 * `lib/seo/route-catalog.ts`, which needs no network at all. No projects, no
 * journal. A palette missing its content is worse than a complete one and far
 * better than a site that does not exist — which is the only other outcome
 * when a prerender throws.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not silent.** A degraded build and a genuinely empty
 * dataset produce the same palette, and only the warning tells them apart.

 * title. Both are true at once, so the fix is not to narrow the haystack but

 * | 1     | something else on the row contains it      |
 * | 0     | no match — the row is not a result at all  |
