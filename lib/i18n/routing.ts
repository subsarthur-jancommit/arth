/**
 * Locale routing — the single source of truth for which locales exist.
 *
 * `localePrefix: 'always'` is deliberate, not the default taken by accident.
 * Both locales carry a path prefix (`/en`, `/id`) and the root redirects.
 *
 * The alternative — root serving the default locale, prefix only for the
 * other — gives the home page two valid URLs. `lib/seo/alternates.ts` is
 * explicit that a page's canonical must match the URL `app/sitemap.ts`
 * submits, or a search engine crawls one and indexes the other. Symmetric
 * prefixes mean exactly one canonical form per page, with no special case in
 * the sitemap, `/llms.txt`, or Markdown negotiation.
 *
 * It also keeps `proxy.ts` simple: 'always' makes next-intl emit plain
 * redirects rather than internal rewrites, so it never competes with the
 * Markdown rewrite that proxy already performs.
 *
 * ## `alternateLinks: false` — one set of hreflang, not two
 *
 * next-intl's proxy also sent its own `Link` header on every page, and it
 * disagreed with the page: `hreflang="en"` and `"id"` against the head's
 * `en-US` and `id-ID`, and `x-default` pointing at the bare root (which only
 * redirects) against the head's `/en`. Measured on the live site, 2026-10-05
 * (`docs/HANDOFF.md` §4.8, L5). A search engine reads both and has to pick;
 * `lib/seo/alternates.ts` is the one source that knows the canonical shape,
 * so the header goes.
