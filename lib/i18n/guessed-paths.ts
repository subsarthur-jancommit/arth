/**
 * URLs a reader would reasonably type, and where they actually belong.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * The header nav reads `WORK · PRACTICE · STUDIO · CONTACT` in English and
 * `KARYA · PRAKTIK · STUDIO · KONTAK` in Indonesian. Three of those four are
 * **anchors on the home page**, not routes — `#work`, `#practice`, `#contact`
 * — and the catalogue lives at `/work` in *both* locales, so the Indonesian
 * segment a reader sees is never the segment the URL uses.
 *
 * A reader who reads a label and types it therefore lands on a 404. Measured
 * against the production build in `docs/stages/TAHAP-22.md` §3:
 *
 * | typed              | before        |
 * | ------------------ | ------------- |
 * | `/en/contact`      | 404           |
 * | `/en/practice`     | 404           |
 * | `/id/kontak`       | 404           |
 * | `/id/praktik`      | 404           |
 * | `/id/karya`        | 404           |
 *
 * Only `/en/contact` was in this stage's spec. The other four were found by
 * checking every label rather than the one that had been reported, and they
 * are the same defect, so they are fixed together.
 *
 * ## Why this is a redirect and not a 404 page improvement
 *
 * A 404 that suggests where to go still costs the reader a page and a
 * decision. And unlike the not-found status itself — which Cache Components
 * force to 200, deliberately, and which `e2e/not-found.e2e.ts` documents —
 * `proxy.ts` runs *before* rendering, so a real 308 is available here.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * `studio` is **not** in this table, and no longer needs to be: Tahap 24 made
 * it a real route, so it resolves rather than being redirected. It moved to
 * `REAL_SEGMENTS` below, which is where a guess must never shadow a page.
 *
 * `practice` and `praktik` were here, pointing at a `#practice` anchor. They
 * are gone as of F1-03: the practice routes are retired, so `/en/practice`
 * now answers `410 Gone` from `lib/seo/route-status.ts` — a real status with
 * a page that says the subject has no successor. A 308 to an anchor would
 * instead have implied the subject moved to the home page, which it did
 * not. The Indonesian spelling of a unit needs no row either: a unit's
 * segment is the same string in both languages, by construction
 * (`lib/content/units.ts`).
 *
 * ## The trade-off, stated
 *
 * These segments become unreachable as CMS page slugs: a Sanity `page`
 * document with slug `contact` would be shadowed by the redirect. Verified
 * against the current dataset — none of these slugs exists — and
 * `guessed-paths.test.ts` asserts the table never collides with a real route.
 * A studio that later wants `/contact` as a CMS page must remove its row
 * here first.

 *
 * `ai` was in this list for a machine view Tahap 84 removed, so for several
 * stages it protected a route that did not exist. Removed: nothing answers
 * at `/en/ai`, and `lib/seo/route-status.ts` is now the thing that decides
 * what an unanswered single segment gets, which it could not do for a
 * segment this list claimed was real.
