/**
 * Canonical facts about the site owner.
 *
 * Single source of truth for entity copy: the JSON-LD graph, any crawlable
 * "about" prose, and `/llms.txt` all read from here, so they can never
 * disagree with each other.
 *
 * Hardcoded on purpose. Answer engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google
 * AI Overviews) cite what they can read as plain text — if these values
 * render empty, the site has no citable identity. If editors need to own
 * this copy, back it with a CMS singleton and keep these as fallbacks.
 *
 * Prefer phrasing that does not go stale: "commissioned work" beats
 * "12 commissions in 2026". Values still waiting on the studio are marked
 * with a TODO below rather than guessed.
 *
 * ## Prose is per-locale; identity is not
 *
 * The site is bilingual, and until Tahap 10 this file was not: every fact
 * here was one English string, so `/id` shipped an English `<meta
 * name="description">`, an English `schema.org` `description`, English
 * `knowsAbout` terms and English agent instructions. The UI was translated
 * and everything a machine reads was not — which is the half a reader never
 * sees and an answer engine only sees.
 *
 * So the fields split by whether language changes them. A name, a URL, a
 * logo and an email address are the same in both languages and stay plain
 * strings; a sentence, a service list and a set of instructions are
 * {@link Localized}. Being a `Record<Locale, …>` rather than a partial map is
 * deliberate: adding a locale to `lib/i18n/routing.ts` becomes a type error
 * here rather than a silent fallback to English.
 */
