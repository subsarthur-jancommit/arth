 * Builds the `alternates` block for one route.

 * Next.js merges metadata shallowly: a child segment that declares its own
 * `alternates` replaces the parent's entire object instead of merging into
 * it. So a page that set `alternates: { canonical: '/ai' }` also dropped the
 * `text/plain` link advertising `/llms.txt` — and `/ai` was the machine view (removed in Tahap 84),
 * the one route that most needs to point crawlers at the plain-text mirror.
 * Routing every page through this helper keeps the shared entries attached.
 *
 * `path` must be the same URL `app/sitemap.ts` submits for the route. A
 * canonical that disagrees with the sitemap asks a search engine to crawl
 * one URL and index another, and the engine picks — usually not the one you
 * wanted. Pass a root-relative path (`/en/work/foo`); Next resolves it
 * against `metadataBase`.
