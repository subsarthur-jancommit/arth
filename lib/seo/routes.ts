 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * `routableContentQuery` above covers `page` and `project` only, and
 * `STATIC_ROUTE_TEMPLATES` carries `/journal` but none of its children. So
 * six real URLs — three entries in two languages — were absent from
 * `sitemap.xml`, `/llms.txt` and `/ai` while being present in the search
 * palette and reachable by a reader. Measured before this existed: the string
 * `/journal/` appeared **once** in the sitemap, for the index.
 *
 * ## Why the labels are localized here and the CMS's are not
 *
 * `localizedContentRoutes` expands a path across locales; it cannot translate
 * a label, because a CMS document's title arrives as one string from one
 * projection. These entries carry both languages already, so the label is
 * resolved per locale rather than left English — which is what a
 * locale-scoped surface needs (`/id/ai` was one until Tahap 84), and what CMS
 * projects still do not get.
 *
 * ## The gap this leaves, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * `resolveJournalEntries(locale, null)` returns the scaffolding, and the entry
 * route reads the same scaffolding (`fallbackEntry`), so the two agree today
 * and every advertised URL resolves. When the studio publishes real entries,
 * **both** have to start reading the CMS together — advertising CMS slugs
 * while the route still serves the fallback would put 404s in the sitemap.
 * `app/[locale]/journal/[slug]/page.tsx` already records that gap as open;
 * this is the second place it now has to be closed.
