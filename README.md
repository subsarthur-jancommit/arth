# Studio Foundation

Foundation for a commissioned-artwork studio website: Next.js 16 App Router,
WebGL as an accent, motion built on measured decisions rather than borrowed
taste.

**This is the foundation, not the finished site.** Pages are designed and built
after this is reviewed. What exists today is the stack, the research, the
design system, and a vault of installable patterns.

---

## Where it came from

Built on **[Satūs](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/satus)** (MIT), the
production Next.js starter by **darkroom.engineering** — the studio that wrote
[Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis), the smooth-scroll
library that turns up in the shipped source of award-winning sites across the
industry.

Starting there means starting from the same line as the studios doing this work
professionally, legally, rather than assembling a stack from tutorials.

`LICENSE` at the root is the project's own: MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 PEEKABOO.
darkroom.engineering's MIT notice for Satūs is kept in full in
[`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), as MIT requires. Full
detail in [`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PROVENANCE.md).

## What has been added

|                       |                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Measured research** | Ten award-winning sites analysed from their live production CSS. Raw counts committed.  |
| **Design system**     | Colour, type, spacing, and grid rules mapped onto the existing token files.             |
| **Motion spec**       | Easing tokens, duration bands, and a mandatory reduced-motion contract.                 |
| **`vault/`**          | Installable, tokenised patterns — motion, primitives, WebGL, blocks.                    |
| **`ui-ux-pro-max`**   | Design skill vendored to `.claude/skills/`, so any agent opening this repo inherits it. |
| **Hard rules**        | `CLAUDE.md` — what agents may and may not do here.                                      |

## Stack

```
next 16.3 · react 19.2 · typescript 7 (strict) · tailwind v4
gsap + lenis + tempus · @react-three/fiber + drei + three + postprocessing
theatre.js · zustand · zod · sanity (optional CMS)
storybook 10 · playwright + @axe-core/playwright · oxlint + oxfmt · bun
```

Shopify, HubSpot and Mailchimp were removed via the starter's own
`setup:project` script. WebGL and Theatre.js were kept; Sanity is optional.

## Quick start

Requires **Bun ≥ 1.3.5** and **Node ≥ 24.20**.

```bash
bun install
bun dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

The site boots without any environment variables, but every integration
self-disables when its own are absent — so a bare `bun dev` renders a page with
no content and no error. **[docs/MENJALANKAN-LOKAL.md](docs/MENJALANKAN-LOKAL.md)**
(Bahasa Indonesia) has the four non-secret values that connect it to the CMS,
and why no token is needed to read it.

| Command             |                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `bun run build`     | production build               |
| `bun run check`     | everything CI runs             |
| `bun test`          | unit tests                     |
| `bun run test:e2e`  | Playwright + axe accessibility |
| `bun run storybook` | component catalogue            |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`                 |
| `bun run lint`      | oxlint                         |

`lefthook` runs oxlint and typecheck on every commit.

## The one finding worth reading first

The easing curves award-winning studios actually ship are **already named
tokens in this repository**. The curve used 60 times on one measured site is
exactly `--ease-out-quart`; another site's is exactly `--ease-out-expo`. The
most common duration across the field is **400ms** — not the 300ms that ships
as a default in most component libraries.

And seven of the ten sites measured ship **no `prefers-reduced-motion`
handling at all**. Every component here honours it.

Evidence: [`docs/TEARDOWN.md`](docs/TEARDOWN.md), raw counts in
`docs/teardown-data.json`.

## Known gaps

Stated plainly rather than left to be found:

1. **No licensed typeface.** Every measured award site self-hosts a commercial
   face. No free substitute reads the same. Highest-leverage upgrade available,
   and a purchasing decision.
2. **No real performance measurement.** Every performance figure in these docs
   is a budget, not a profiler result.
3. **Art direction is open** — accent colour, typeface, and voice are
   deliberately undecided. The system is built to accept them.
4. **GSAP plugin licensing is settled**, and is no longer a gap. Checked
   2026-09-18; `docs/PROVENANCE.md` §2 carries the terms and the correction —
   the plugin list this entry used to cite was itself wrong, naming a
   `Draggable` the source has never imported.
