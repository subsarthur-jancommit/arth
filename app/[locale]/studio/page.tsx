/**
 * The studio page — who works here, and what happens if you hire them.
 *
 * ## Why this route exists
 *
 * `STUDIO` has been in the header since the first stage, pointing at a `#studio`
 * anchor on the home page. Tahap 22 measured the consequence: `/en/studio`
 * answered with "Page not found", and it was the one nav label that stage
 * deliberately did **not** redirect, on the written promise that it would
 * become a real route here.
 *
 * ## The text is scaffolding, and that is deliberate
 *
 * The owner's instruction for this stage: write the copy as layout scaffolding,
 * because the whole site's text is going to be replaced later, and focus on
 * design and motion. So the copy is written to **realistic length** — a
 * two-line heading, a three-line lead, a 90-110 word statement — because a
 * layout proved with one short sentence breaks the moment real prose arrives.
 *
 * The colophon is the exception: those facts are true, and left true, so one
 * section of this page needs no rewrite later.
 *
 * ## What it reuses, and why nothing is new
 *
 * Every moving part here already ships elsewhere: `TextReveal` for the `h1`
 * (the entrance vocabulary Tahap 23 unified), `Reveal` for block entrances,
 * and `ProgressText` for the long statement — whose own doc names this exact
 * case, *"a long passage the reader moves through"*, and which until now lived
 * on one route type only.
 *
 * One choreographed moment, and it has a name: **`studio-statement`**, the
 * scrub. `docs/MOTION-SPEC.md` §9.5 allows two per page; using one is
 * restraint rather than a shortfall.
 *
 * The sticky section label in "how we work" is **layout, not animation** — CSS
 * `position: sticky`, no JavaScript, no bytes, and nothing that counts against
 * that budget of two.

            The capabilities, at the foot of the hero — Tahap 69.

            They used to sit at `y=4255` of a 5008px page: **160px at 85%
            depth**, behind a 2232px process sequence. The same twelve items
            Tahap 65 gave a full pinned screen to on `/practice/<value>` were,
            on the page that exists to say what this studio does, the least
            likely thing on it to be read.

            Meanwhile this box held `100svh` for a motion reason that is real
            and was re-checked (§1.1 of the stage spec) — and left **493px,
            63% of itself, empty** underneath its two columns. One move
            answers both: the page's most concrete statement goes where the
            page is most read, and it costs **no page height at all**, because
            it fills slack the hero had already reserved.

            Not spread, and not expanded: the block moves as it is. A hero
            that grew a twelve-item feature list would be the pattern
            `e2e/taste-preflight.e2e.ts` existed to keep out — a judgement the
            fork (`docs/FORK.md`) returned to the designer with that file.

            **Tahap 77 turned the rest of this note into data.** It used to
            read that the rule "is scoped to `[data-epic="hero-arrival"]` and
            cannot see this header, which makes it guidance here rather than a
            gate". That was true, and two other stages wrote the same sentence
            about other heroes. The scope then lived in `STACK_EXEMPT` in
            `e2e/hero-stack.ts`, with this header as an entry carrying the
            measurement above as its reason. The fork deleted that sweep and
            its list: a hero's stack is a design choice again. Stack measured 8.

          The work the statement above is about — Tahap 44.

          Placed after the statement rather than before it, and that ordering
          is the whole argument: a studio page that opens with pictures is a
          portfolio, and `/work` is already the portfolio. This page says what
          the studio does and then shows that it has done it. Evidence follows
          a claim; it does not replace one.

          `Reveal` and nothing else — no new named moment, no `data-epic`.
          `MOTION-SPEC.md` §9.5 already allots this page two, and each card
          brings its own `work-transport` for the navigation it starts. Adding
          motion to a page that was short of *content* would only have made
          the emptiness move.

              `ProjectGrid` calls `useFlipGrid`, because the catalogue needs
              to animate surviving cards when a filter changes the list under
              them. Nothing on this page ever changes this list, so the FLIP
              module and its ScrollTrigger import were weight shipped to run
              nothing: `/en/studio` went from 856KB to **902KB** against a
              900KB ceiling in `e2e/route-budget.e2e.ts`.

              `ProjectCard` is still reused — it is the card, and this strip
              must be the same object the rest of the site shows. What is not
              reused is the grid host, which exists for a behaviour this page
              does not have.
