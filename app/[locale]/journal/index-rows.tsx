'use client'

/**
 * The journal index's rows, and the one that is being read.
 *
 * ## Why this is a client island rather than the whole page
 *
 * `app/[locale]/journal/page.tsx` is a Server Component: it resolves the CMS
 * against the scaffolding, formats dates in the reader's locale, and reads
 * translations on the server. None of that should move to the client to make
 * three rows respond to a scroll position. So the page keeps that work and
 * hands this component the rows it has already resolved.
 *
 * ## What it adds, and the measurement behind it
 *
 * Tahap 26 shipped this index with a container reveal and nothing else, and
 * all four of its reveal items sat above the fold: the entrance fired once on
 * the first frame and the page was static from then on. Measured at four
 * scroll positions, the three rows reported `1.00 1.00 1.00` every time — on
 * a page whose entire content is three headlines.
 *
 * So the row at the reading line leads and the others recede, using the same
 * `useActiveInSequence` the studio page's process uses. That is deliberate
 * reuse rather than a second mechanism: `CLAUDE.md` closes on restraint
 * applied *consistently*, and a behaviour that lives on one page is an
 * exception rather than a vocabulary.
 *
 * **Scroll-led, not pointer-led.** An index that only answers a mouse does
 * not exist on a phone, and the journal index is the page most likely to be
 * read on one.

   * importing `SanityImage` here put it and its dependencies into the
   * island's bundle: `/en/journal` went from 870KB to **901KB** against a
   * 900KB ceiling in `e2e/route-budget.e2e.ts`.
   *
   * An element crosses the RSC boundary fine — it is a value, not a function
   * — so the page renders the image where it already renders the date and
   * the practice label, and the island receives finished markup. The rule
   * this stays inside is the one `vault/motion/counter` learned in Tahap 42:
   * a *function* cannot cross that boundary; the output of one can.
   *
   * `null` when the entry has no practice, or the practice has no listed work
   * behind it. That is designed absence rather than a placeholder: an empty
   * frame says "an image failed", and nothing says "there is nothing here to
   * show yet", which is the truth.

                  `subject`, not `mid`: a cover here is the only picture in a
                  column of type, so it is the subject of its row rather than
                  something behind it. The named plane is what keeps it related

                  `Plane` and not `useParallax` directly, and that is not a
                  preference: these rows are a `map`, and a ref per item cannot

                  for existing at all.

                  sizes itself from `--plane-travel`, which `Plane` publishes,
