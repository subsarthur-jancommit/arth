/**
 * The journal index — what the studio has written, newest first.
 *
 * ## Where the entries come from
 *
 * The CMS when it has any, `lib/content/journal-fallback.ts` when it does not,
 * and **all or nothing** — merging the two would put scaffolding articles
 * beside the studio's real ones with nothing on the page to tell a reader
 * which is which. `journal-fallback.test.ts` asserts the precedence rather
 * than leaving it to be read out of the code.
 *
 * Nothing was written into the dataset to make this page renderable. That
 * decision, and the reasoning, is `lib/content/home-fallback.ts`'s, taken
 * again unchanged: the alternatives were a blank page or invented articles in
 * a studio's live content library.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * `TextReveal` on the `h1` — the site's entrance vocabulary — and one
 * choreographed moment, `journal-index`, which lives in `index-rows.tsx`.
 *
 * It shipped in Tahap 26 with **no** moment, and Tahap 27 measured what that
 * meant: all four reveal items sat above the fold, so the entrance fired once
 * on the first frame and the three rows reported `1.00 1.00 1.00` at every
 * scroll position afterwards. On a page whose entire content is three
 * headlines, that was the whole experience of it.
 *
 * The moment reuses `useActiveInSequence` rather than introducing a mechanism
 * — the same one the studio page's process uses. `MOTION-SPEC.md` §9.5 allows
 * two per page; this uses one.
 *
 * The summaries are **not** hidden behind hover. An index whose content only
 * appears when pointed at cannot be used with a keyboard and cannot be read
 * on a touch screen; hover and focus add the acknowledgement the site's
 * interaction grammar already defines, and nothing more.

/**
 * One work per practice, so a journal row has something to look at —
 * Tahap 44.
 *
 * ## Why the practice and not a named project
 *
 * The plan asked for the project an entry "names". `schemas/journalEntry.ts`
 * has no field that can name one — `title`, `slug`, `date`, `summary`,
 * `body`, `practice`, `listed`, and nothing else. Adding a reference field
 * would have shipped a column with no data behind it: none of the entries
 * would set it, so the page would render the same zero images it renders
 * now, only with more schema.
 *
 * Every entry does carry a practice, and every practice has work behind it.
 * An essay about a practice sitting beside work from that practice is a
 * relationship the data already asserts — nothing here is invented, which is
 * what `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s standing rule 10 requires.
 *
 * ## Why a list per practice rather than one cover per practice
 *
 * Measured on `/en/journal` with a single cover per practice: two of the
 * three entries are `consulting`, so two rows carried **the same picture** —
 * three images, two descriptions. A repeated image down an index does not
 * read as "these share a practice", it reads as a bug: the eye finds the
 * repetition before it finds the reason.
 *
 * So each practice keeps its whole list in catalogue order and the rows draw
 * from it in turn, wrapping when there are more entries than works.
 * `projectsQuery` is already ordered `order asc, publishedAt desc`, so a
 * given entry gets a given cover on every render rather than one that moves
 * between builds.
