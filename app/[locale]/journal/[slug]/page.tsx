/**
 * One journal entry.
 *
 * ## Why this reads the fallback rather than the CMS today
 *
 * The dataset holds no `journalEntry` documents — none were written into it,
 * for the reason `lib/content/journal-fallback.ts` records. So this route
 * resolves against the scaffolding, and `notFound()` for anything else.
 *
 * When the studio publishes, `resolveJournalEntries` stops returning the
 * scaffolding entirely and this route needs the CMS branch its index sibling
 * already has. That is a small, contained change, and it is left undone
 * rather than written blind against a shape no document has taken yet —
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-26.md` §8 states it as the stage's one deliberate gap
 * rather than leaving it to be discovered.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * `TextReveal` on the `h1` and the container reveal on the blocks. Nothing
 * else: this is a page of prose, and the curated motion data this project
 * reads is explicit that body copy is the one thing not to animate against
 * scroll.

 * the data asserts rather than one invented to fill a hole.

          `Reveal` and nothing else: no named moment, no `data-epic`. This
          page's one choreographed moment is `journal-transport` arriving
          from the index, and a second would need a §9.5 amendment for an
          image that is context rather than subject.

          A `div`, not a `figure`: `Reveal`'s `as` admits only the elements it
          has been reasoned about on, and widening that union for one call
