            have animated on exactly one route — for a transition, the same as
            none. This is a CSS wipe and costs no library on any route.

            The `<Suspense>` is required, not stylistic: the overlay reads
            `usePathname()` to know when a route has committed, and under
            Cache Components URL data in a client component must sit behind a
            boundary. Scoping it to this one decorative element with a `null`
            fallback is what keeps the page content itself out of a boundary —

            It costs no library on any route. Until Tahap 18c the follow ran
            on `gsap.quickTo`, and `e2e/route-budget.e2e.ts` then allowed GSAP

            have turned that gate red on three routes. The follow now runs on
            the Tempus loop the site already has, which `CLAUDE.md` #6 wanted
            anyway.
