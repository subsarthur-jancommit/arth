/**
 * The localized 404.
 *
 * Every string here used to be an English literal, rendered under whatever
 * `<html lang>` the route carried — so `/id/apa-pun` announced itself as
 * Indonesian and then spoke English, which is the failure WCAG 3.1.1 is about
 * and which axe cannot see (`html-has-lang` only checks the attribute exists).
 *
 * The shared `NotFoundView` keeps English defaults because
 * `app/global-error.tsx` renders outside the intl provider and cannot
 * translate; this route passes real translations in.
