/**
 * The catalogue body, shared by `/work` and `/work/practice/[value]`.
 *
 * ## Why the two routes are separate pages rather than one page and a query
 *
 * Tahap 8 built this as a single route reading `?practice=`, and Tahap 10
 * §1.4 initially decided to keep that shape. Two build errors overturned it,
 * and both are reproducible:
 *
 *   - `searchParams` outside a `<Suspense>` fails the build outright under
 *     `cacheComponents` — *"Next.js encountered uncached or runtime data
 *     during prerendering"*.
 *   - `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is rejected too — *"Route
 *     segment config "dynamic" is not compatible with
 *     `nextConfig.cacheComponents`"*.
 *
 * So a route that reads a query string must put its content behind a Suspense
 * boundary, and content behind a Suspense boundary is streamed in and swapped
 * by an inline script. Measured on the built site: `/en/work` with JavaScript
 * disabled rendered its heading and the word *Loading*, and not one project.
 *
 * That is the exact failure `docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` §2.1 was about.
 * `lib/seo/site.ts` instructs agents to browse `/en/work`, and an answer
 * engine fetching it over plain HTTP would have found an empty catalogue.
 *
 * Path segments cost one reserved slug (`lib/content/practices.ts`) and buy:
 * every view fully server-rendered, `Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000`, no
 * Suspense fallback, and three extra indexable landing pages per locale in
 * `sitemap.xml`.
 */

/**
 * `'use cache'` is required, not stylistic: `sanityFetch` calls `cacheTag()`
 * internally, and under Cache Components that is only legal inside a cached
 * function. Locale and practice are arguments so both are part of the key.
 *
 * Published perspective only, and no `draftMode()` — for the reasons set out
 * at length in `work/[slug]/page.tsx`. Reading the draft cookie is a
 * request-time access, and it would put this page straight back into the
 * dynamic hole the route shape above exists to escape.
