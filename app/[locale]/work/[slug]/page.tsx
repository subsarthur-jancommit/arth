/*
 * Published content only, and deliberately no `draftMode()`.
 *
 * `'use cache'` is required, not stylistic: `sanityFetch` calls `cacheTag()`
 * internally, and under Cache Components that is only legal inside a cached
 * function. Slug and locale are arguments so both are part of the cache key.
 *
 * ## Why draft mode is gone
 *
 * Reading `draftMode()` is a request-time access, which pushes the whole page
 * into a dynamic hole. Two things were measured as a result, and neither was
 * a theory:
 *
 *   - with JavaScript off the page rendered 28 characters — the real markup
 *     sat in a `<div hidden>` only an inline script reveals
 *     (`docs/stages/TAHAP-9.md` §1);
 *   - the response was `Cache-Control: no-store`, so every view of the most
 *     shareable page class on the site hit the origin and Sanity
 *     (`docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` §Tier 1).
 *
 * `app/[locale]/page.tsx` justified keeping it by calling these routes
 * "dynamic (◐) by nature and lose nothing". That sentence was wrong, and it
 * is what this change corrects.
 *
 * ## What it costs, stated plainly
 *
 * The Presentation tool no longer previews *unpublished* edits to a project.
 * It still previews published ones live, through `SanityLive` tag
 * revalidation. Three things make that trade the right way round:
 * `docs/PANDUAN-STUDIO.md` teaches the studio to publish and look — it never
 * mentions preview at all; `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` marks the token
 * "Recommended", not required; and the home page made this exact trade in
 * Tahap 3, so keeping project pages different would be two rules for one
 * question.

 * slug against staying dynamic, and called the sentinel "worse than the
 * alternative". That judgment was sound given what was known — and what was

 *     class hit the origin and Sanity (`docs/AUDIT-2026-08.md` §Tier 1).
 *
 * Against that, one unlisted 404 route on an empty dataset is cheap.
 *
 * ## What still works when the CMS changes
 *
 * `dynamicParams` defaults to true, so a project published after the last
 * build still renders — on demand, then cached by `'use cache'` and
 * revalidated by the publish webhook. Prerendering is an optimisation here,
 * not a gate on content existing.

            The arc — Tahap 79.

            This section is not a new idea. `project-spine` records that the
            plan named Brief/Approach/Outcome and that the regions shipped as
            Overview/Notes/Images instead, because "a project has one `body` of
            Portable Text, so those sections do not exist and writing them
            would be inventing content". That was right, and it stayed right
            for thirty-nine stages. What changed is the content model, not the
            judgement: `chapters` exists now, so the sections can be rendered
            from what an editor wrote rather than invented.

            It sits between the prose and the pictures because the order comes
            from `ui-ux-pro-max`'s `scroll-triggered-storytelling` pattern —
            problem, journey, solution — and because putting it above the hero
            would push the fact `<dl>` below the 800px fold that
            `e2e/project-detail.e2e.ts:100` holds.

            `data-epic` takes this route from one named moment to two, against
            a ceiling of six. Not six: the same pattern's GSAP entry warns
            against pinning more than one or two sections per page, and this
            page already carries a latent pinned run in its gallery.
