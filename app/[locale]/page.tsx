 * the home page — it still previews published changes live through
 * `SanityLive` tag revalidation. Project and article pages keep their draft

 * there is work, and Process is not built at all because no real content for
 * it exists yet (see `docs/stages/TAHAP-3.md` §1).

 * section that does not exist is a link that silently does nothing — and with
 * an empty dataset that is exactly what `#work` would be.
 *
 * ## Content precedence
 *
 * The CMS wins field by field; `resolveHomeContent` documents why per-field
 * and not per-document. With the dataset empty today, every string here comes
 * from the fallback — which is placeholder copy, and says so on the page.
