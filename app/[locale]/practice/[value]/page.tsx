/**
 * `/[locale]/practice/[value]` — the page about one practice.
 *
 * ## Why a page and not the filtered catalogue it replaces
 *
 * These three values have been structural vocabulary since Tahap 13: a closed
 * schema list, a URL segment, JSON-LD entries, the catalogue's filter chips,
 * three lines in the home hero, and since Tahap 14b a `<details>` on the home
 * page. What they never had was somewhere that is *about* them — only a
 * listing narrowed to them, which answers "what work is there" and not "what
 * is this".
 *
 * `/work/practice/<value>` used to be that listing. It now redirects here, so
 * one subject has one URL. Two would split what an answer engine reads and
 * make a reader choose between them for no reason —
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-15.md` §5.1.
 *
 * ## Where the content comes from
 *
 * The nameplate's sentence is `workIndex.<practice>Intro`, written in Tahap 13
 * and already used as each filtered catalogue's masthead — real copy, both
 * languages, nothing invented here. The work is the CMS's. Only the statement
 * is new prose, and it is **marked as placeholder** with the same mechanism
 * the home page uses, because the studio has not written it. Tahap 13 §9 stays
 * open; this page does not pretend otherwise.
 *
 * ## `gsap`, not `webgl`
 *
 * `ProgressText` scrubs word opacity against scroll position, which needs
 * ScrollTrigger. That is the only heavy library this route opts into:
 * `e2e/route-budget.e2e.ts` allows three.js on exactly one route and this is
 * not it, so the plates here are the plain images `/en/work` renders.
 */

interface PracticePageProps {
  params: Promise<{ value: string }>
}

/**
 * Static, complete, and independent of the CMS — the same reasoning the
 * filtered route carried. Three compile-time values, so no Sanity round trip
 * and no empty-dataset sentinel.
 */
/**
 * This route blocks on its own params, and says so.
 *
 * Next 16 reports a route that reads `params` outside a `<Suspense>` as one
 * that "may prevent the navigation from being instant", and offers two ways
 * out: stream a placeholder, or declare the route blocking. Tahap 16c
 * measured the first one. Wrapping this page's body in `<Suspense>` took its
 * no-JavaScript render from **924 characters to 20** — literally
 * "Skip to main content" — because everything here depends on `params` and so
 * there is no smaller unit to wrap; the shell that arrives instantly is an
 * empty page.
 *
 * That is the same regression `e2e/no-javascript.e2e.ts` was built to stop
 * after a single `loading.tsx` reduced the home page to 28 characters for a
 * crawler. Trading the site's readability without JavaScript for a shell with
 * nothing in it is not a trade worth making.
 *
 * So the honest declaration is this one. It changes no behaviour — the route
 * already blocked — it states the intent, and it silences a diagnostic that
 * would otherwise train everyone to ignore the console.
 * `docs/stages/TAHAP-16.md` §7 carries the measurement.

          moment on this route that holds.

          The content is not new. `studio.capabilities.<value>` has carried
          twelve items across three lines since Tahap 24 and rendered only on
          `/studio`, as three lines of `caption`. `docs/stages/TAHAP-52.md`
          §2.1 refused to build this section and was right about the file it
          read — there is no capability list on this page — and wrong about
          the repository, where the list had been sitting in the dictionary
          the whole time. So this ships the shape, not the words.

          It sits below the statement and above the grid on purpose: the
          statement makes a claim about how the practice works, "what that
          covers" is the question that claim raises, and the work is the
          evidence that answers both. Putting it under the grid would answer a
          question the reader had already stopped asking.

          Splitting happens on the server. `capabilityItems` is pure and the
          items cross into the client component as props, so the list is in
          the initial HTML — `e2e/no-javascript.e2e.ts` tests all three of
          these routes, and a section that assembled itself in an effect would
          be blank for a reader without JavaScript.
