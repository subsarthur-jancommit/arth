/**
 * Next.js Request Proxy

 * - Rate limiting: Adjust rateLimiters config per route pattern
 * - Auth: Add token/session validation before route matching
 * - Logging: Add request logging for observability
 * - CORS: Add custom CORS headers for API routes

 * under `app/(chrome)/`, deliberately outside the localized tree. That would
 * take the CMS offline while every page still looked fine.
 *
 * It was `/studio` until Tahap 38, and that was a collision, not a choice:
 * `/[locale]/studio` is a public page, and because this list makes `/studio`
 * unlocalizable, `components/ui/link` refused to prefix it — so the footer's
 * one link to the studio page rendered `href="/studio"` and served the CMS
 * login instead. Measured on the production build: 200, `<title>Sanity
 * Studio</title>`. `docs/stages/TAHAP-15.md` §1.3 had already recorded that
 * `/studio` was taken; Tahap 24 built the page there anyway.
 *
 * Everything else that must stay unlocalized is already excluded upstream:
 * `/api/*` and `/_next/*` by `isPageDocumentRequest`, `/agent-content` by
 * `MACHINE_PATHS`, dotted paths (`/llms.txt`, `/manifest.webmanifest`,
 * `/icon.png`) by `FILE_EXTENSION`, and `/robots.txt` + `/sitemap.xml` by the
